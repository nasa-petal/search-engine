cellular and molecular biology of the aquaporin water channels ||||| the high water permeability characteristic of mammalian red cell membranes is now known to be caused by the protein aqp this channel freely permits movement of water across the cell membrane but it is not permeated by other small uncharged molecules or charged solutes aqp is a tetramer with each subunit containing an aqueous pore likened to an hourglass formed by obversely arranged tandem repeats cryoelectron microscopy of reconstituted aqp membrane crystals has revealed the three dimensional structure at a aqp is distributed in apical and basolateral membranes of renal proximal tubules and descending thin limbs as well as capillary endothelia ten mammalian aquaporins have been identified in water permeable tissues and fall into two groupings orthodox aquaporins are water selective and include aqp a vasopressin regulated water channel in renal collecting duct in addition to aqp aqp and aqp multifunctional aquaglyceroporins aqp aqp and aqp are permeated by water glycerol and some other solutes aquaporins are being defined in numerous other species including amphibia insects plants and microbials members of the aquaporin family are implicated in numerous physiological processes as well as the pathophysiology of a wide range of clinical disorders
spider web protection through visual advertisement role of the stabilimentum ||||| the conspicuous white silken adornments known as stabilimenta which are commonly found in the orb webs of some spiders appear to be protective devices that warn birds of the presence of webs in their flight path webs endowed with artificial equivalents of stabilimenta tended to survive intact the early morning period when birds are on the wing unmarked webs showed a high incidence of destruction
the venus flytrap dionaea muscipula counts prey induced action potentials to induce sodium uptake ||||| summary carnivorous plants such as the venus flytrap dionaea muscipula depend on an animal diet when grown in nutrient poor soils when an insect visits the trap and tilts the mechanosensors on the inner surface action potentials aps are fired after a moving object elicits two aps the trap snaps shut encaging the victim panicking preys repeatedly touch the trigger hairs over the subsequent hours leading to a hermetically closed trap which via the gland based endocrine system is flooded by a prey decomposing acidic enzyme cocktail here we asked the question as to how many times trigger hairs have to be stimulated e g now many aps are required for the flytrap to recognize an encaged object as potential food thus making it worthwhile activating the glands by applying a series of trigger hair stimulations we found that the touch hormone jasmonic acid ja signaling pathway is activated after the second stimulus while more than three aps are required to trigger an expression of genes encoding prey degrading hydrolases and that this expression is proportional to the number of mechanical stimulations a decomposing animal contains a sodium load and we have found that these sodium ions enter the capture organ via glands we identified a flytrap sodium channel dmhkt as responsible for this sodium acquisition with the number of transcripts expressed being dependent on the number of mechano electric stimulations hence the number of aps a victim triggers while trying to break out of the trap identifies the moving prey as a struggling na rich animal and nutrition for the plant video abstract
calcitic microlenses as part of the photoreceptor system in brittlestars ||||| photosensitivity in most echinoderms has been attributed to diffuse dermal receptors here we report that certain single calcite crystals used by brittlestars for skeletal construction are also a component of specialized photosensory organs conceivably with the function of a compound eye the analysis of arm ossicles in ophiocoma showed that in light sensitive species the periphery of the labyrinthic calcitic skeleton extends into a regular array of spherical microstructures that have a characteristic double lens design these structures are absent in light indifferent species photolithographic experiments in which a photoresist film was illuminated through the lens array showed selective exposure of the photoresist under the lens centres these results provide experimental evidence that the microlenses are optical elements that guide and focus the light inside the tissue the estimated focal distance um below the lenses coincides with the location of nerve bundles the presumed primary photoreceptors the lens array is designed to minimize spherical aberration and birefringence and to detect light from a particular direction the optical performance is further optimized by phototropic chromatophores that regulate the dose of illumination reaching the receptors these structures represent an example of a multifunctional biomaterial that fulfills both mechanical and optical functions
gait selection in the ostrich mechanical and metabolic characteristics of walking and running with and without an aerial phase ||||| it has been argued that minimization of metabolic energy costs is a primary determinant of gait selection in terrestrial animals this view is based predominantly on data from humans and horses which have been shown to choose the most economical gait walking running galloping for any given speed it is not certain whether a minimization of metabolic costs is associated with the selection of other prevalent forms of terrestrial gaits such as grounded running a widespread gait in birds using biomechanical and metabolic measurements of four ostriches moving on a treadmill over a range of speeds from to m s we reveal here that the selection of walking or grounded running at intermediate speeds also favours a reduction in the metabolic cost of locomotion this gait transition is characterized by a shift in locomotor kinetics from an inverted pendulum gait to a bouncing gait that lacks an aerial phase by contrast when the ostrich adopts an aerial running gait at faster speeds there are no abrupt transitions in mechanical parameters or in the metabolic cost of locomotion these data suggest a continuum between grounded and aerial running indicating that they belong to the same locomotor paradigm
resilience in social insect infrastructure systems ||||| both human and insect societies depend on complex and highly coordinated infrastructure systems such as communication networks supply chains and transportation networks like human designed infrastructure systems those of social insects are regularly subject to disruptions such as natural disasters blockages or breaks in the transportation network fluctuations in supply and or demand outbreaks of disease and loss of individuals unlike human designed systems there is no deliberate planning or centralized control system rather individual insects make simple decisions based on local information how do these highly decentralized leaderless systems deal with disruption what factors make a social insect system resilient and which factors lead to its collapse in this review we bring together literature on resilience in three key social insect infrastructure systems transportation networks supply chains and communication networks we describe how systems differentially invest in three pathways to resilience resistance redirection or reconstruction we suggest that investment in particular resistance pathways is related to the severity and frequency of disturbance in the final section we lay out a prospectus for future research human infrastructure networks are rapidly becoming decentralized and interconnected indeed more like social insect infrastructures human infrastructure management might therefore learn from social insect researchers who can in turn make use of the mature analytical and simulation tools developed for the study of human infrastructure resilience
neurology an ancient sensory organ in crocodilians ||||| crocodilians hunt at night waiting half submerged for land bound prey to disturb the water surface here i show that crocodilians have specialized sensory organs on their faces that can detect small disruptions in the surface of the surrounding water and which are linked to a dedicated hypertrophied nerve system such dome pressure receptors are also evident in fossils from the jurassic period indicating that these semi aquatic predators solved the problem of combining armour with tactile sensitivity many millions of years ago
anti erosion function in animals and its biomimetic application ||||| material failure is usually caused by corrosion wear and mechanical damage according to previous researches erosion wear holds about of regular wear in industrial production in the present work a new approach which adopted the idea of coupling bionics to improve erosion resistance of machine parts was presented simulation by ansys ls dyna finite element software was applied to predict the relative erosion severity and experiment optimum design theory was employed to design experiment scheme silica sand of particle size um um was used as the erodent the erosion tests were carried out to validate the simulation results obtained it is shown that the simulation results are in agreement with those of the experiment the morphologies of eroded surface were examined by scanning electron microscope and the possible wear mechanism was discussed
the use of waggle dance information by honey bees throughout their foraging careers ||||| we studied the extent to which worker honey bees acquire information from waggle dances throughout their careers as foragers small groups of foragers were monitored from time of orientation flights to time of death and all in hive behaviors relating to foraging were recorded in the context of a novice forager finding her first food source of the bees relied at least in part on acquiring information from waggle dances being recruited rather than searching independently scouting in the context of an experienced forager whose foraging has been interrupted of the time the bees resumed foraging by following waggle dances being reactivated rather than examining the food source on their own inspecting and in the context of an experienced forager engaged in foraging of the time the bees initiated a foraging trip by following a waggle dance such dance following was observed much more often after an unsuccessful than after a successful foraging trip successful foragers often followed dances just briefly perhaps to confirm that the kind of flowers they had been visiting were still yielding forage overall waggle dance following for food discovery accounted for of all interactions with dancers by novice foragers and by experienced foragers whereas dance following for reactivation and confirmation accounted for the other for reactivation and for confirmation we conclude that foragers make extensive use of the waggle dance not only to start work at new unfamiliar food sources but also to resume work at old familiar food sources
raptorial jaws in the throat help moray eels swallow large prey ||||| most bony fishes rely on suction mechanisms to capture and transport prey once captured prey are carried by water movement inside the oral cavity to a second set of jaws in the throat the pharyngeal jaws which manipulate the prey and assist in swallowing moray eels display much less effective suction feeding abilities given this reduction in a feeding mechanism that is widespread and highly conserved in aquatic vertebrates it is not known how moray eels swallow large fish and cephalopods here we show that the moray eel muraena retifera overcomes reduced suction capacity by launching raptorial pharyngeal jaws out of its throat and into its oral cavity where the jaws grasp the struggling prey animal and transport it back to the throat and into the oesophagus this is the first described case of a vertebrate using a second set of jaws to both restrain and transport prey and is the only alternative to the hydraulic prey transport reported in teleost fishes the extreme mobility of the moray pharyngeal jaws is made possible by elongation of the muscles that control the jaws coupled with reduction of adjacent gill arch structures the discovery that pharyngeal jaws can reach up from behind the skull to grasp prey in the oral jaws reveals a major innovation that may have contributed to the success of moray eels as apex predators hunting within the complex matrix of coral reefs this alternative prey transport mode is mechanically similar to the ratcheting mechanisms used in snakes a group of terrestrial vertebrates that share striking morphological behavioural and ecological convergence with moray eels
fm echolocating bats shift frequencies to avoid broadcast echo ambiguity in clutter ||||| sonar broadcasts are followed by echoes at different delays from objects at different distances when broadcasts are emitted rapidly in cluttered surroundings echo streams from successive broadcasts overlap and cause ambiguity in matching echoes to corresponding broadcasts to identify reactions to ambiguity in clutter echolocating bats that emit multiple harmonic fm sounds were trained to fly into a dense extended array of obstacles multiple rows of vertically hanging chains while the sonar sounds the bat emitted were recorded with a miniature radio microphone carried by the bat flight paths were reconstructed from thermal infrared video recordings successive rows of chains extended more than m in depth so each broadcast was followed by a series of echoes from multiple rows of chains that lasted up to ms bats emitted sounds in pairs strobe groups at short ms interpulse intervals ipis alternating with longer ipis ms for many short ipis the stream of echoes from the first broadcast was still arriving when the second broadcast was emitted this overlap caused ambiguity about matching echoes with broadcasts bats shifted frequencies of the first sound in each strobe group upward and the second sound downward by khz when overlap and ambiguity ceased frequency shifts ceased also frequency differences were small compared with the total broadcast band which was khz wide but the harmonic structure of echoes enhances the differences in spectrograms bats could use time frequency comparisons of echoes with broadcasts to assign echoes to the corresponding broadcasts and thus avoid ambiguity
comprehensive mapping of long range interactions reveals folding principles of the human genome ||||| chromosomal mapping the conformation of the genome in the nucleus and contacts between both proximal and distal loci influence gene expression in order to map genomic contacts lieberman aiden et al p see the cover developed a technique to allow the detection of all interactions between genomic loci in the eukaryotic nucleus followed by deep sequencing this technology was used to map the organization of the human genome and to examine the spatial proximity of chromosomal loci at one megabase resolution the map suggests that the genome is partitioned into two spatial compartments that are related to local chromatin state and whose remodeling correlates with changes in the chromatin state chromosomes are organized in a fractal knot free conformation that is densely packed while easily folded and unfolded we describe hi c a method that probes the three dimensional architecture of whole genomes by coupling proximity based ligation with massively parallel sequencing we constructed spatial proximity maps of the human genome with hi c at a resolution of megabase these maps confirm the presence of chromosome territories and the spatial proximity of small gene rich chromosomes we identified an additional level of genome organization that is characterized by the spatial segregation of open and closed chromatin to form two genome wide compartments at the megabase scale the chromatin conformation is consistent with a fractal globule a knot free polymer conformation that enables maximally dense packing while preserving the ability to easily fold and unfold any genomic locus the fractal globule is distinct from the more commonly used globular equilibrium model our results demonstrate the power of hi c to map the dynamic conformations of whole genomes
factors affecting the geometry of silver nanoparticles synthesis in chrysosporium tropicum and fusarium oxysporum ||||| problem statement biosynthesis of nanoparticles using fungal cells is a novel approach to develop biotechnological possess such as bioleaching and bioremediation in the present study an effort was made to investigate the effect of physio chemical parameters on the silver nanoparticle formation with the fungus chrysosporium tropicum carmichael and fusarium oxysporum schltdl approach the possibilities to manipulating the geometry of silver nanoparticles by altering the key growth parameters such as ph temperature concentrations and time have been explored the effect of agno with the cell free extract of fungi and time temperature ph with the formation of silver has also been investigated the presence of nanosilver has been carried out with the micro scan reader and has been confirmed by x rays diffractometer xrd the micrographs of the silver nanoparticles have been evaluated through the transmission electron microscope tem and confirmed by scanning electron microscope sem the effect of concentrations with response to time temperature and ph has studied with the help of micro scan reader and their microstructure analyzed by tem and sem results it was observed that fungus c tropicum and f oxysporum schltdl significantly activate the extra cellular production of silver nanoparticles the different sized and spherical shaped nanoparticles have been formed in different strains with the increase in concentration the absorbance increased with response to time h and temperature significantly the ph was found decreasing with the increase of absorbance conclusion we presume that these changes initiate new geometry of nanosilver in the cell free solutions these different shaped sized and geometry of nanoparticles can be used in the field of medicine for drug formation and diseases diagnosis
carrion feeding on the sediment surface at nocturnal low tides by the polychaete phyllodoce mucosa ||||| harsh physical conditions in the intertidal zone are the cause of an ample amount of dead macroinvertebrates which constitute a food source for carrion feeders in the european wadden sea this trophic guild includes decapod crustaceans and fish when the tide is in while during nocturnal low tides the polychaete phyllodoce mucosa is attracted in large numbers by dead mollusks crabs or worms on the sediment surface within s worms emerged to the surface crawled as far as m on mucus trails towards the carcass sucked in tissue up to one third of their own weight and then quickly retreated to below the surface abundance of p mucosa was highest in the lower intertidal zone and winter the seaward high abundance pattern however did not continue into the shallow subtidal in summer few were attracted during daytime or when the tide was in however up to worms aggregated at a single crushed mussel within min at dusk during low tide exposure this study suggests that during winter carrion feeding is an important trophic niche on cold temperate intertidal mud flats occupied by a phyllodocid polychaete that is segregated in feeding time from most other scavengers and benefits from cold sensitive benthic invertebrates
catapulting tentacles in a sticky carnivorous plant ||||| among trapping mechanisms in carnivorous plants those termed active have especially fascinated scientists since charles darwin s early works because trap movements are involved fast snap trapping and suction of prey are two of the most spectacular examples for how these plants actively catch animals mainly arthropods for a substantial nutrient supply we show that drosera glanduligera a sundew from southern australia features a sophisticated catapult mechanism prey animals walking near the edge of the sundew trigger a touch sensitive snap tentacle which swiftly catapults them onto adjacent sticky glue tentacles the insects are then slowly drawn within the concave trap leaf by sticky tentacles this is the first detailed documentation and analysis of such catapult flypaper traps in action and highlights a unique and surprisingly complex mechanical adaptation to carnivory
magnetic termite mound surfaces are oriented to suit wind and shade conditions ||||| summarythe termites amitermes meridionalis and a laurensis construct remarkable meridional or magnetic mounds in northern australia these mounds vary geographically in mean orientation in a manner that suggests such variation is an adaptive response to local environmental conditions theoretical modelling of solar irradiance and mound rotation experiments show that maintenance of an eastern face temperature plateau during the dry season is the most likely physical basis for the mound orientation response subsequent heat transfer analysis shows that habitat wind speed and shading conditions also affect face temperature gradients such as the rate of eastern face temperature change it is then demonstrated that the geographic variation in mean mound orientation follows the geographic variation in long term wind speed and shading conditions across northern australia such that an eastern face temperature plateau is maintained in all locations
butterfly wing colors glass scales of graphium sarpedon cause polarized iridescence and enhance blue green pigment coloration of the wing membrane ||||| summary the wings of the swordtail butterfly graphium sarpedon nipponum contain the bile pigment sarpedobilin which causes blue green colored wing patches locally the bile pigment is combined with the strongly blue absorbing carotenoid lutein resulting in green wing patches and thus improving camouflage in the dorsal forewings the colored patches lack the usual wing scales but instead have bristles we have found that on the ventral side most of these patches have very transparent scales that enhance by reflection the wing coloration when illuminated from the dorsal side these glass scales furthermore create a strongly polarized iridescence when illuminated by obliquely incident light from the ventral side presumably for intraspecific signaling a few ventral forewing patches have diffusely scattering white scales that also enhance the blue green wing coloration when observed from the dorsal side
biomechanics turning the key on drosophila audition ||||| the genetic dissection of drosophila audition is advancing considerably but complementary studies are needed to unravel the chain of mechanosensory events that bring about hearing in the fly here we investigate the delicate biomechanics of the fly s minute antennal hearing organs and show that they look and work like a lock and key rotating in response to sound the antenna s distal segment mechanically activates the auditory receptors thereby unlocking the mechanism of drosophila audition
adaptive aerial righting during the escape dropping of wingless pea aphids ||||| summary pea aphids acyrthosiphon pisum are small sap sucking insects that live on plants in colonies containing mostly wingless individuals they often escape predators parasitoids and grazing mammalian herbivores by dropping off the plant avoiding immediate danger but exposing themselves to ground predators starvation and desiccation we show here that dropping pea aphids land on their legs regardless of their initial orientation on the plant like a defenestrated cat by rotating their body during the fall this righting ability is intriguing as wingless aphids have no specialized structures for maneuvering in mid air instead they assume a stereotypic posture which is aerodynamically stable only when the aphids fall right side up consequently the body passively rotates to the stable upright orientation improving the chance of clinging to leaves encountered on the way down and lowering the danger of reaching the ground
dynamic mechanical properties of the tissue engineered matrix associated with individual chondrocytes ||||| the success of cell based tissue engineering approaches in restoring biological function will be facilitated by a comprehensive fundamental knowledge of the temporal evolution of the structure and properties of the newly synthesized matrix here we quantify the dynamic oscillatory mechanical behavior of the engineered matrix associated with individual chondrocytes cultured in vitro for up to days in alginate scaffolds the magnitude of the complex modulus e and phase shift delta were measured in culture medium using atomic force microscopy afm based nanoindentation in response to an imposed oscillatory deformation amplitude approximately nm as a function of frequency f hz probe tip geometry microm radius sphere and nm radius square pyramid and in the absence and presence of growth factors gf insulin growth factor igf and osteogenic protein op e for all conditions increased nonlinearly with frequency dependence approximately f and ranged between approximately and kpa this result along with theoretical calculations of the characteristic poroelastic relaxation frequency f p approximately hz suggested that this time dependent behavior was governed primarily by fluid flow dependent poroelasticity rather than flow independent viscoelastic processes associated with the solid matrix e f increased f decreased and the hydraulic permeability k decreased with time in culture and with growth factor treatment this trend of a more elastic like response was thought to be associated with increased macromolecular biosynthesis density and a more mature matrix structure organization
comparative overwintering physiology of alaska and indiana populations of the beetle cucujus clavipes fabricius roles of antifreeze proteins polyols dehydration and diapause ||||| summary the beetle cucujus clavipes is found in north america over a broad latitudinal range from north carolina latitude degn to near tree line in the brooks range in alaska latitude deg n the cold adaptations of populations from northern indiana deg n and alaska were compared and as expected the supercooling points the temperatures at which they froze of these freeze avoiding insects were significantly lower in alaska insects both populations produce glycerol but the concentrations in alaska larvae were much higher than in indiana insects and mol l respectively in addition both populations produce antifreeze proteins interestingly in the autumn both populations have the same approximate level of hemolymph thermal hysteresis indicative of antifreeze protein activity suggesting that they synthesize similar amounts of antifreeze protein a major difference is that the alaska larvae undergo extreme dehydration in winter wherein water content decreases from body water g h o g dry mass in summer to body water g h o g dry mass in winter these fold reductions in body water greatly increase the concentrations of antifreeze in the alaska insects glycerol concentrations would increase to mol l while thermal hysteresis increased to nearly degc the highest ever measured in any organism in concentrated hemolymph by contrast indiana larvae do not desiccate in winter the alaska population also undergoes a diapause while insects from indiana do not the result of these and likely additional adaptations is that while the mean winter supercooling points of indiana larvae were approximately degc those of alaska larvae were to degc and at certain times alaska c clavipes did not freeze when cooled to degc
novel acetylenic oxylipins from the moss dicranum scoparium with antifeeding activity against herbivorous slugs ||||| mosses are seldom fed upon even in areas where intense herbivore pressure is observed on other plants but even more than years after the first investigations of ernst stahl on the chemical defense of plants and mosses against slugs and snails we know very little about the nature and biosynthesis of metabolites responsible for moss chemical defense dicranum scoparium is an example of a well defended moss it is globally distributed in temperate and arctic forests and often occurs in dense patches that show no sign of herbivory in a recent survey of the volatile oxylipins products of the oxidative transformation of polyunsaturated fatty acids from mosses we identified d scoparium as a prolific producer of such metabolites in addition this moss produces unusual acetylenic cyclopentenones from the dominant acetylenic fatty acid dicranin presumably also by means of oxylipin pathways motivated by the observation that oxylipins often serve as defense metabolites or regulators of defense reactions in higher plants we explored the chemistry and chemical ecology of oxylipins of d scoparium as observed in higher plants and diatoms the production of volatile oxylipins is triggered by mechanical wounding in mosses as well comparing the ultraperformance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry uplc ms profiles of methanolic extracts obtained from d scoparium before and after tissue disruption revealed that a complex mixture of metabolites is produced within seconds after wounding figure owing to the complexity of the chromatograms we aimed to address the metabolic pathways guided by biosynthetic precursors labeled with stable isotopes therefore we prepared monoand dideuterated fatty acids and administered them to the moss scheme the acetylenic fatty acid dicranin proved to be of special interest as a precursor of unusual novel oxylipins after a min administration of monoor dideuterated dicranin suspended in water to frozen powdered moss a complex mix of deuterated metabolites formed since not all oxylipins were chromatographically separated a manual evaluation of uplc ms data ran the risk of overlooking relevant signals we therefore used an automated peak extraction routine that delivers mass retention time pairs for every compound these data from nontreated controls and mixtures obtained after treatment with monoor dideuterated dicranin were then evaluated using a canonical analysis of principal coordinates that enabled the rapid identification of dicranin derived peaks figure see the supporting information for experimental details in contrast to the established manual evaluation of uplc ms runs this analysis allows an automated quick and comprehensive survey of metabolites derived from labeled precursors this method covers the entire range of polarities and molecular weights recorded in lc ms runs and picks up even minor or chromatographically not separated metabolites the use of two precursors with different degrees of labeling in separate experiments supports the automated evaluation of the chromatogram since the second treatment serves as additional independent replicate figure c the use of only one labeled precursor is also feasible but more care has to be taken in the manual verification of the identified signals to avoid false positive hits mass retention time pairs identified in the canonical analysis were used as guides in the purification of dicranin derived metabolites using preparative hplc structure elucidation of compounds and was based on oneand two dimensional nmr as well as uv ir and ms data the structure of was tentatively assigned based on derivatization and gc ms data scheme synthesis of monoand dideuterated fatty aicds a lda quenching with meod b naome meod c koh h o
biology reveals new ways to hold on tight ||||| at an unusual recent meeting biologists and materials scientists swapped notes about how natural and artificial adhesives work the materials scientists discussed physical or chemical properties that biologists should consider as they try to figure out how nature performs its sticky tricks the biologists described how various organisms stay put by bringing the two disciplines together the defense advanced research projects agency which funded the symposium hoped to stimulate insights that might one day lead to more effective adhesives
physiological and anatomical changes during the early ontogeny of the heteroblastic bromeliad vriesea sanguinolenta do not concur with the morphological change from atmospheric to tank form ||||| two distinct morphological forms characterize the ontogeny of many epiphytic bromeliads smaller plants exhibit an atmospheric habit while larger plants form water impounding tanks the study of the functional significance of heteroblasty in epiphytes is severely hampered by considerable size related variation in morphological anatomical and physiological parameters to overcome this problem plants of varying size of both atmospheric and tank form were included in the present study with vriesea sanguinolenta the results show that virtually all morphological anatomical and physiological characteristics vary during ontogeny but changes were rarely directly related to the step change in gross morphology changes were either gradual from smallest atmospheric to small tank e g leaf divergence angles reduction in photosystem ii efficiency during drought speed of recovery after drought there was no change between atmospheric and small tank but a gradual or step change within the tank form stomatal density relationship of leaf n and specific leaf area or developmental patterns were more complicated with decreases and increases during ontogeny photosynthetic capacity carbon isotope ratios abscisic acid levels during drought although the comparisons between ontogenetic phases were always confounded by size differences a hypothetical small tank plant is expected to suffer higher water loss than a real atmospheric whereas a hypothetical large atmospheric plant would show reduced access to resources such as nutrients in comparison with the real tank the present results are consistent with the notion of heteroblasty as an adaptation of early ontogenetic stages to drought but highlight that size related variation greatly modifies any difference directly associated with the step change from atmospheric to tank
evidence for wavelike energy transfer through quantum coherence in photosynthetic systems ||||| photosynthetic complexes are exquisitely tuned to capture solar light efficiently and then transmit the excitation energy to reaction centres where long term energy storage is initiated the energy transfer mechanism is often described by semiclassical models that invoke hopping of excited state populations along discrete energy levels two dimensional fourier transform electronic spectroscopy has mapped these energy levels and their coupling in the fenna matthews olson fmo bacteriochlorophyll complex which is found in green sulphur bacteria and acts as an energy wire connecting a large peripheral light harvesting antenna the chlorosome to the reaction centre the spectroscopic data clearly document the dependence of the dominant energy transport pathways on the spatial properties of the excited state wavefunctions of the whole bacteriochlorophyll complex but the intricate dynamics of quantum coherence which has no classical analogue was largely neglected in the analyses even though electronic energy transfer involving oscillatory populations of donors and acceptors was first discussed more than years ago and electronic quantum beats arising from quantum coherence in photosynthetic complexes have been predicted and indirectly observed here we extend previous two dimensional electronic spectroscopy investigations of the fmo bacteriochlorophyll complex and obtain direct evidence for remarkably long lived electronic quantum coherence playing an important part in energy transfer processes within this system the quantum coherence manifests itself in characteristic directly observable quantum beating signals among the excitons within the chlorobium tepidum fmo complex at k this wavelike characteristic of the energy transfer within the photosynthetic complex can explain its extreme efficiency in that it allows the complexes to sample vast areas of phase space to find the most efficient path
teaching in tandem running ants ||||| the ant temnothorax albipennis uses a technique known as tandem running to lead another ant from the nest to food with signals between the two ants controlling both the speed and course of the run here we analyse the results of this communication and show that tandem running is an example of teaching to our knowledge the first in a non human animal that involves bidirectional feedback between teacher and pupil this behaviour indicates that it could be the value of information rather than the constraint of brain size that has influenced the evolution of teaching
hierarchical organisation of the trap in the protocarnivorous plant roridula gorgonias roridulaceae ||||| summary the flypaper trap of the protocarnivorous plant roridula gorgonias is known to capture various insects even those having a considerable body size by using an adhesive visco elastic resinous secretion released by glandular trichomes of different dimensions however recent experimental studies have shown that the adhesion of long tentacle shaped trichome secretion is not as strong as previously assumed one may then ask why this flypaper trap is so highly effective in the present study we compared geometry flexibility and the adhesive properties of secretion in different sized trichomes we have analysed the gross morphology of the plant and its surfaces using light and cryo scanning electron microscopy trichomes stiffness and the adhesive properties of their secretion on different surfaces were measured a combination of structural and experimental results presented in this study let us suggest that r gorgonias represents a three dimensional trap consisting of three functional hierarchical levels plant leaves and trichomes according to their size we classified three types of trichomes having a particular arrangement on the leaf the longest trichomes are more flexible and less adhesive compared with the shortest ones the latter are times stiffer and their secretion has a times higher adhesive strength our data support the hypothesis that the shortest trichomes are adapted to strong long term adherence to prey insects and that the longest trichomes are responsible for initial trapping and entanglement function
plant bacteria partnerships for the remediation of hydrocarbon contaminated soils ||||| plant bacteria partnerships have been extensively studied and applied to improve crop yield in addition to their application in agriculture a promising field to exploit plant bacteria partnerships is the remediation of soil and water polluted with hydrocarbons application of effective plant bacteria partnerships for the remediation of hydrocarbons depend mainly on the presence and metabolic activities of plant associated rhizo and endophytic bacteria possessing specific genes required for the degradation of hydrocarbon pollutants plants and their associated bacteria interact with each other whereby plant supplies the bacteria with a special carbon source that stimulates the bacteria to degrade organic contaminants in the soil in return plant associated bacteria can support their host plant to overcome contaminated induced stress responses and improve plant growth and development in addition plants further get benefits from their associated bacteria possessing hydrocarbon degradation potential leading to enhanced hydrocarbon mineralization and lowering of both phytotoxicity and evapotranspiration of volatile hydrocarbons a better understanding of plant bacteria partnerships could be exploited to enhance the remediation of hydrocarbon contaminated soils in conjunction with sustainable production of non food crops for biomass and biofuel production
expanding dialogues from natural autoinducers to non natural analogues that modulate quorum sensing in gram negative bacteria ||||| bacteria are capable of communicating their local population densities via a process termed quorum sensing qs gram negative bacteria use n acylated l homoserine lactones ahls in conjunction with their cognate luxr type receptors as their primary signalling circuit for qs in this critical review we examine ahl signalling in gram negative bacteria with a primary focus on the design of non natural ahls their structure activity relationships and their application in chemical biological approaches to study qs references
rapid increase of vacuolar volume in response to salt stress ||||| abstract suspension cultured cells of mangrove bruguiera sexangula lour poir showed a rapid increase in vacuolar volume under salt stress although there was no change in the cell volume the rapid increase in the vacuolar volume was an active process which followed the activation of the tonoplast h atpase and the vacuolar acid phosphatase the same phenomenon was observed in barley hordeum vulgare l cv doriru root meristematic cells under salt stress but not in pea pisum sativum l increases in vacuolar volume could potentially protect the cytoplasm by decreasing the cytoplasmic volume during the initial phases of salt stress

a test of the function of drip tips ||||| 
natural freezing survival in animals ||||| natural freeze tolerance supports the winter survival of many animals including numerous terrestrial insects many intertidal marine invertebrates and selected species of terrestrially hibernating amphibians and reptiles freeze tolerant animals typically endure the conversion of or more of total body water into extracellular ice and employ a suite of adaptations that counter the negative consequences of freezing specific adaptations control the sites and rate of ice formation to prevent physical damage by ice other adaptations regulate cell volume change colligative cryoprotectants minimize cell shrinkage during extracellular ice formation other protectants stabilize membrane structure and a high density of membrane transporter proteins ensure rapid cryoprotectant distribution cell survival during freezing is also potentiated by anoxia tolerance mechanisms of metabolic rate depression and antioxidant defenses the net result of these protective mechanisms is the ability to reactivate vital functions after days or weeks of continuous freezing magnetic resonance imaging has allowed visual examinations of the mode of ice penetration through the body of freeze tolerant frogs and turtles and cryomicroscopy has illustrated the effects of freezing on the cellular and microvasculature structure of tissues various metabolic adaptations for freezing survival appear to have evolved out of pre existing physiological capacities of animals including desiccation resistance and anoxia tolerance
multifocal lenses compensate for chromatic defocus in vertebrate eyes ||||| abstract the focal length of the vertebrate eye is a function of wavelength i e the eye suffers from longitudinal chromatic aberration chromatic defocus is a particularly severe problem in eyes with high light gathering ability since depth of field is small due to a pupillary opening that is large in relation to the focal length of the eye calculations show that in such eyes only a narrow spectral band of light can be in focus on the retina for the major part of the visual spectrum spatial resolution should be limited by the optics of the eye and far lower than the resolving power achievable by the retinal cone photoreceptor mosaic to solve this problem fishes with irises unresponsive to light have developed lenses with multiple focal lengths well focused images are created at the wavelengths of maximum absorbance of all spectral cone types multifocal lenses also appear to be present in some terrestrial species in eyes with mobile irises multifocal lenses are correlated with pupil shapes that allow all zones of the lens with different refractive powers to participate in the imaging process irrespective of the state of pupil constriction
hydraulic leg extension is not necessarily the main drive in large spiders ||||| summary unlike most other arthropods spiders have no extensor muscles in major leg joints therefore hydraulic pressure generated in the prosoma provides leg extension for decades this mechanism was held responsible for the generation of the majority of the ground reaction forces particularly in the hind legs during propulsion the front leg pairs must shorten whereas the hind legs have to be extended assuming that hind legs are essentially driven by hydraulics their force vectors must pass the leg joints ventrally however at least in accelerated escape manoeuvres we show here for the large cursorial spider species ancylometes concolor that these force vectors when projected into the leg plane pass all leg joints dorsally this indicates a reduced impact of the hydraulic mechanism on the generation of ground reaction forces although hydraulic leg extension still modulates their direction the observed steep force vectors at the hind legs indicate a strong activity of flexors in the proximal joint complex that push the legs against the substrate consequently the muscular mechanisms are dominant at least in the hind legs of large spiders
die spiegeloptik des flusskrebsauges ||||| summaryin the superposition eye of the crayfish astacus leptodactylus images are formed by radial plane mirrors arranged in an orthogonal pattern the optical structure of the crayfish eye can be described as a family of virtual reflecting cone envelopes concentric around each direction in space there exist two reflection mechanisms total internal reflection at the sides of the crystalline cones and reflection by multilayer mirrors attached to the distal parts of the cones image forming rays have to be reflected twice in the general case and once in the case of perpendicular position of the plane of incidence and the mirror plane for rays incident at small angles to the ommatidial axis this condition is almost satisfied due to a particular axial variation of the refractive index of the crystalline cone and for rays incident at large angles due to the spectral reflecting properties of the multilayer reflector
botany a record breaking pollen catapult ||||| the release of stored elastic energy often drives rapid movements in animal systems and plant components employing this mechanism should be able to move with similar speed here we describe how the flower stamens of the bunchberry dogwood cornus canadensis rely on this principle to catapult pollen into the air as the flower opens explosively our high speed video observations show that the flower opens in less than ms to our knowledge the fastest movement so far recorded in a plant
natural strategies for the molecular engineer ||||| the idea of nature as engineer is an old one but the realization that this metaphor can be extended should we say retracted to the molecular scale has become common currency only over the past two decades or so two reasons for this are perhaps paramount first the picture of the cell has been transformed from that of a wet chemical melange a vessel filled with a homogeneous solution in which all chemical processes take place as franz hofmeister put it in into an image of a sort of fluid factory a production plant in which molecular machinery works in near fantastic orchestration to generate complex products from raw materials this mechanism is self assembling self repairing and self replicating the concept of proteins and nucleic acids as molecular machines is now a mainstream one in cell biology second technological advances have made us accustomed to the idea that engineering can be conducted at scales too small to see with the naked eye yet employing principles mechanical electrical hydraulic optical tribological familiar from the macroscopic world molecular electronics and computing microelectromechanical devices and nanotechnology are now mainstream concepts and are validated by at least some degree of physical realization in this article i shall briefly review some of nature s principles and practices at the molecular supramolecular and submicrometre scales and attempt to illustrate how these can be adapted for developing synthetic chemical and materials systems sharing the kind of superior properties and special functions that natural systems exhibit
how do sucker footed bats hold on and why do they roost head up ||||| individuals of most bat species hang head down by their toenails from rough surfaces but madagascar s endemic sucker footed bat myzopoda aurita clings head up to smooth leaves using specialized pads on its wrists and ankles we investigated the adhesive performance of individuals and found that attachment performance on brass was not affected by the presence or absence of a seal around the pad surface interface furthermore on smooth acrylic the wrist pads were more than nine fold weaker when lifted perpendicular to the surface than when pulled parallel to it the unimportance of a seal and the difference in strength in those directions on a smooth surface are characteristic of wet adhesion but not of suction thus despite its name the sucker footed bat appears to adhere using wet adhesion we observed that when wrist pads were pushed anteriorly they unpeeled easily from the surface because of deformation of the pads this most likely permits rapid detachment during crawling but would also cause passive detachment if bats roosted head down this provides an ecomorphological explanation to the head up roosting behaviour of these unique bats the results obtained in the present study thus link morphology behaviour and roosting ecology for an enigmatic malagasy endemic c the linnean society of london biological journal of the linnean society additional keywords detachment ecomorphology head up posture myzopoda roosting posture suction thyroptera wet adhesion
the structure of the cushions in the feet of african elephants loxodonta africana ||||| the uniquely designed limbs of the african elephant loxodonta africana support the weight of the largest terrestrial animal besides other morphological peculiarities the feet are equipped with large subcutaneous cushions which play an important role in distributing forces during weight bearing and in storing or absorbing mechanical forces although the cushions have been discussed in the literature and captive elephants in particular are frequently affected by foot disorders precise morphological data are sparse the cushions in the feet of african elephants were examined by means of standard anatomical and histological techniques computed tomography ct and magnetic resonance imaging mri in both the forelimb and the hindlimb a th ray the prepollex or prehallux is present these cartilaginous rods support the metacarpal or metatarsal compartment of the cushions none of the rays touches the ground directly the cushions consist of sheets or strands of fibrous connective tissue forming larger metacarpal metatarsal and digital compartments and smaller chambers which were filled with adipose tissue the compartments are situated between tarsal metatarsal metacarpal bones proximal phalanges or other structures of the locomotor apparatus covering the bones palmarly plantarly and the thick sole skin within the cushions collagen reticulin and elastic fibres are found in the main parts vascular supply is good and numerous nerves course within the entire cushion vater pacinian corpuscles are embedded within the collagenous tissue of the cushions and within the dermis meissner corpuscles are found in the dermal papillae of the foot skin the micromorphology of elephant feet cushions resembles that of digital cushions in cattle or of the foot pads in humans but not that of digital cushions in horses besides their important mechanical properties foot cushions in elephants seem to be very sensitive structures
thermal windows on brazilian free tailed bats facilitate thermoregulation during prolonged flight ||||| the brazilian free tailed bat tadarida brasiliensis experiences challenging thermal conditions while roosting in hot caves flying during warm daylight conditions and foraging at cool high altitudes using thermal infrared cameras we identified hot spots along the flanks of free ranging brazilian free tailed bats ventral to the extended wings these hot spots are absent in syntopic cave myotis myotis velifer a species that forages over relatively short distances and does not engage in long distance migration we hypothesized that the hot spots or radiators on brazilian free tailed bats may be adaptations for migration particularly in this long distance high flying species we examined the vasculature of radiators on brazilian free tailed bats with transillumination to characterize the unique arrangements of arteries and veins that are positioned perpendicular to the body in the proximal region of the wing we hypothesized that these radiators aid in maintaining heat balance by flushing the uninsulated thermal window with warm blood thereby dissipating heat while bats are flying under warm conditions but shunting blood away and conserving heat when they are flying in cooler air at high altitudes we also examined fluid preserved specimens representing species from of chiropteran families and radiators appeared present only in species in the family molossidae including both sedentary and migratory species and subspecies thus the radiator appears to be a unique trait that may facilitate energy balance and water balance during sustained dispersal foraging and long distance migration
always on the bright side of life anti adhesive properties of insect ommatidia grating ||||| summary the surface of some insect eyes consists of arrays of cuticular protuberances which are nm in diameter and are termed corneal nipples or ommatidia gratings they were widely reported to reduce the reflectance for normally incident light contributing to camouflage by reducing glare to predators while furthermore enhancing the intake of light which is especially important for nocturnal insects our preliminary observations suggest a third function in contrast to the rest of the body ommatidia of various insects remain clean even in a heavy contaminated environment in order to prove such an anti contamination hypothesis of these structures we measured the adhesive properties of polymer moulds of insect ommatidia and compared these data with control surfaces having the same curvature radii but lacking such a nanostructure a scanning electron microscope sem study and force measurements using an atomic force microscope afm on the eye surfaces of three different insect species dragonfly aeshna mixta odonata moth laothoe populi lepidoptera and fly volucella pellucens diptera were undertaken we revealed that adhesion is greatly reduced by corneal grating in l populi and v pellucens when compared with their smooth controls the smooth cornea of a mixta showed no statistically significant difference to its control we assume that this anti adhesive phenomenon is due to a decrease in the real contact area between contaminating particles and the eye s surface such a combination of three functions in one nanostructure can be interesting for the development of industrial multifunctional surfaces capable of enhancing light harvesting while reducing light reflection and adhesion
surface tension transport of prey by feeding shorebirds the capillary ratchet ||||| the variability of bird beak morphology reflects diverse foraging strategies one such feeding mechanism in shorebirds involves surface tension induced transport of prey in millimetric droplets by repeatedly opening and closing its beak in a tweezering motion the bird moves the drop from the tip of its beak to its mouth in a stepwise ratcheting fashion we have analyzed the subtle physical mechanism responsible for drop transport and demonstrated experimentally that the beak geometry and the dynamics of tweezering may be tuned to optimize transport efficiency we also highlight the critical dependence of the capillary ratchet on the beak s wetting properties thus making clear the vulnerability of capillary feeders to surface pollutants
the winter diet of the atlantic puffin fratercula arctica around the faroe islands ||||| most mortality of atlantic puffins occurs outside the breeding season but little is known about the species diet at that time the stomach contents of puffins shot legally for food around the faroe islands between october and january in three winters were examined the remains of species of fish six species of crustacea and single species of polychaete chaetognathid and squid were identified the most frequently recorded prey in terms of frequency of occurrence were group year old lesser sandeel ammodytes marinus of stomachs followed by mesopelagic fish nereid worms silver rockling gaidropsarus argentatus crustacea large sandeel and other large fish in terms of calculated biomass nereids large sandeel and other large fish made up the bulk of the diet but the latter two prey types were most important in energetic terms despite accounting for only of items stomach contents collected on the same day and location were significantly more similar than those collected on different dates and locations suggesting that during the winter puffins are generalists taking any prey they encounter
deep sea swimming worms with luminescent bombs ||||| several species of deep sea polychaete worms have been discovered that have a bizarre predator distraction mechanism by using remotely operated vehicles we found seven previously unknown species of swimming annelid worms below meters specimens were large and bore a variety of elaborate head appendages in addition five species have pairs of ellipsoidal organs homologous to branchiae that produce brilliant green bioluminescence when autotomized five genes were used to determine the evolutionary relationships of these worms within cirratuliformia these species form a clade within acrocirridae and were not closely related to either of the two known pelagic cirratuliforms thus this clade represents a third invasion of the pelagic realm from cirratuliformia this finding emphasizes the wealth of discoveries to be made in pelagic and deep demersal habitats
structure and mechanical behavior of a toucan beak ||||| abstract the toucan beak which comprises one third of the length of the bird and yet only about th of its mass has outstanding stiffness the structure of a toco toucan ramphastos toco beak was found to be a sandwich composite with an exterior of keratin and a fibrous network of closed cells made of calcium rich proteins the keratin layer is comprised of superposed hexagonal scales mm diameter and mm thickness glued together its tensile strength is about mpa and young s modulus is gpa micro and nanoindentation hardness measurements corroborate these values the keratin shell exhibits a strain rate sensitivity with a transition from slippage of the scales due to release of the organic glue at a low strain rate x s to fracture of the scales at a higher strain rate x s the closed cell foam is comprised of fibers having a young s modulus twice as high as the keratin shells due to their higher calcium content the compressive response of the foam was modeled by the gibson ashby constitutive equations for open and closed cell foam there is a synergistic effect between foam and shell evidenced by experiments and analysis establishing the separate responses of shell foam and foam shell the stability analysis developed by karam and gibson assuming an idealized circular cross section was applied to the beak it shows that the foam stabilizes the deformation of the beak by providing an elastic foundation which increases its brazier and buckling load under flexure loading
salt allocation during leaf development and leaf fall in mangroves ||||| abstract by taking samples along individual branches and measuring leaf size thickness and na and k concentrations we have shown in bruguiera cylindrica avicennia rumphiana and avicennia marina that there are two phases of salt accumulation by leaves this is confirmed by re analysis of published data for other species the first phase is a rapid increase in leaf content as it grows from bud to maturity the second is a slower but continuous change in quantity in the leaf via changes in ion concentration and or in leaf thickening leaf thickening must not be overlooked in estimating changes in leaf contents with age generally leaf na content increases significantly and k content falls slightly mangrove leaves thus continue as sinks for na throughout their lifetime at the end of a leaf s life just before abscission no burst of salt accumulation has been found yellow senescent leaves do not have higher na than old green ones we point out that leaf drop involves losing both salt and biomass not just salt and hence does not reduce the salt concentration in the plant we conclude that leaf drop is not a salt excretion mechanism but is simply the point in time at which the leaf ceases to accumulate salt using a simple model the contribution to salt accumulation of slowly accumulated na by mature leaves has been calculated for b cylindrica the most extensively studied species of the salt in the leaf is accumulated slowly in the mature phase thus more than during the initial phase of rapid expansion growth the limited data suggest that gland bearing species show smaller changes in mature leaf na content than do gland less species
dead leaves and fire survival in southern african tree aloes ||||| summarymany aloe species in southern africa have stems clothed with a layer of persistent dead leaves the degree of stem coverage is species specific the suggestion that persistent dead leaves have an insulatory function and are adaptive in fire prone habitat was tested on aloe ferox field surveys demonstrated a significant negative relationship between mortality and degree of stem coverage and laboratory studies confirmed the insulating properties of dead leaves the distribution of southern african tree aloes supprts the prediction that bare stemmed species would be confined to fire free habitat whilst fully clothed species would occur in both fire prone and fire free habitat the study suggests that harvesting of aloe ferox leaves for medicinal purposes could result in significant mortality in fires
underwater locomotion in a terrestrial beetle combination of surface de wetting and capillary forces ||||| for the first time we report the remarkable ability of the terrestrial leaf beetle gastrophysa viridula to walk on solid substrates under water these beetles have adhesive setae on their feet that produce a secretory fluid having a crucial role in adhesion on land in air adhesion is produced by capillary forces between the fluid covered setae and the substrate in general capillary forces do not contribute to adhesion under water however our observations showed that these beetles may use air bubbles trapped between their adhesive setae to walk on flooded inclined substrata or even under water beetle adhesion to hydrophilic surfaces under water was lower than that in air whereas adhesion to hydrophobic surfaces under water was comparable to that in air oil covered hairy pads had a pinning effect retaining the air bubbles on their feet bubbles in contact with the hydrophobic substrate de wetted the substrate and produced capillary adhesion additional capillary forces are generated by the pad s liquid bridges between the foot and the substrate inspired by this idea we designed an artificial silicone polymer structure with underwater adhesive properties
soil immune responses ||||| soil microbiomes may be harnessed for plant health soil microorganisms are central to the provision of food feed fiber and medicine engineering of soil microbiomes may promote plant growth and plant health thus contributing to food security and agricultural sustainability however little is known about most soil microorganisms and their impact on plant health disease suppressive soils offer microbiome mediated protection of crop plants against infections by soil borne pathogens understanding of the microbial consortia and mechanisms involved in disease suppression may help to better manage plants while reducing fertilizer and pesticide inputs
impact behaviour of freeze dried and fresh pomelo citrus maxima peel influence of the hydration state ||||| pomelos citrus maxima are known for their thick peel which inter alia serves as energy dissipator when fruits impact on the ground after being shed it protects the fruit from splitting open and thus enables the contained seeds to stay germinable and to potentially be dispersed by animal vectors the main part of the peel consists of a parenchymatous tissue that can be interpreted from a materials point of view as open pored foam whose struts are pressurized and filled with liquid in order to investigate the influence of the water content on the energy dissipation capacity drop weight tests were conducted with fresh and with freeze dried peel samples based on the coefficient of restitution it was found that freeze drying markedly reduces the relative energy dissipation capacity of the peel measuring the transmitted force during impact furthermore indicated a transition from a uniform collapse of the foam like tissue to a progressive collapse due to water extraction representing the peel by a maxwell model illustrates that freeze drying not only drastically reduces the damping function of the dashpots but also stiffens the springs of the model
evolutionary significance of awn length variation in a clonal grass of fire prone savannas ||||| we investigated the selective advantage of continuous variation of awn length in the clonal grass hyparrhenia diplandra poaceae in a west african tropical savanna ivory coast that burns every year this species is apomictic so all seeds produced by one mother plant have the same genotype h diplandra produces diaspores with a hygroscopic awn whose length varies within and among plants in other grass species awns play a significant role in secondary dispersal on the ground and in seed burial using an experimental approach we quantified the environmental and genetic components of awn length variation the influence of awn length variation on seed burial depth the effect of awn length on seed germination and seedling survival rates in burned and unburned plots and the potential role of fire intensity in selecting diaspores with different awn lengths awn length varied from to mm and was highly heritable h variation within individuals was not related to flowering p
bacterial rhodopsin evidence for a new type of phototrophy in the sea ||||| extremely halophilic archaea contain retinal binding integral membrane proteins called bacteriorhodopsins that function as light driven proton pumps so far bacteriorhodopsins capable of generating a chemiosmotic membrane potential in response to light have been demonstrated only in halophilic archaea we describe here a type of rhodopsin derived from bacteria that was discovered through genomic analyses of naturally occuring marine bacterioplankton the bacterial rhodopsin was encoded in the genome of an uncultivated gamma proteobacterium and shared highest amino acid sequence similarity with archaeal rhodopsins the protein was functionally expressed in escherichia coli and bound retinal to form an active light driven proton pump the new rhodopsin exhibited a photochemical reaction cycle with intermediates and kinetics characteristic of archaeal proton pumping rhodopsins our results demonstrate that archaeal like rhodopsins are broadly distributed among different taxa including members of the domain bacteria our data also indicate that a previously unsuspected mode of bacterially mediated light driven energy generation may commonly occur in oceanic surface waters worldwide
from three dimensional weavings to swollen corneocytes ||||| a novel technique to generate three dimensional euclidean weavings composed of close packed periodic arrays of one dimensional fibres is described some of these weavings are shown to dilate by simple shape changes of the constituent fibres such as fibre straightening the free volume within a chiral cubic example of a dilatant weaving the ideal conformation of the g weaving related to the s rod packing expands more than fivefold on filament straightening this remarkable three dimensional weaving therefore allows an unprecedented variation of packing density without loss of structural rigidity and is an attractive design target for materials we propose that the g weaving ideal s weaving is formed by keratin fibres in the outermost layer of mammalian skin probably templated by a folded membrane
magnetosome formation in prokaryotes ||||| magnetotactic bacteria were discovered almost years ago and for many years and many different reasons the number of researchers working in this field was few and progress was slow recently however thanks to the isolation of new strains and the development of new techniques for manipulating these strains researchers from several laboratories have made significant progress in elucidating the molecular biochemical chemical and genetic bases of magnetosome formation and understanding how these unique intracellular organelles function we focus here on this progress
electron transfer in syntrophic communities of anaerobic bacteria and archaea ||||| interspecies electron transfer is a key process in methanogenic and sulphate reducing environments bacteria and archaea that live in syntrophic communities take advantage of the metabolic abilities of their syntrophic partner to overcome energy barriers and break down compounds that they cannot digest by themselves here we review the transfer of hydrogen and formate between bacteria and archaea that helps to sustain growth in syntrophic methanogenic communities we also describe the process of reverse electron transfer which is a key requirement in obligately syntrophic interactions anaerobic methane oxidation coupled to sulphate reduction is also carried out by syntrophic communities of bacteria and archaea but as we discuss the exact mechanism of this syntrophic interaction is not yet understood
fog basking by the namib desert beetle onymacris unguicularis ||||| the namib desert along the south western coast of africa supports a sand dune fauna without counterpart elsewhere in the world the trophic base of the arthropod fauna is wind blown detritus aperiodic advective fog collection from vegetation or detritus is a possible source of water for diverse namib animals for the specialised fauna living in vegetation less dunes fog collection from detritus disturbed sand projections directly from humid air or from water precipitated on the body seem to be the only possible water uptake methods water uptake from saturated or subsaturated air demonstrated for a few arthropod species is not a physiological capability of namib tenebrionids already investigated
from the first intention movement to the last joiner macaques combine mimetic rules to optimize their collective decisions ||||| mechanisms related to collective decision making have recently been found in almost all animal reigns from amoebae to worms insects and vertebrates including human beings decision making mechanisms related to collective movements including pre departure and joining have already been studied at different steps of the movement process but these studies were always carried out separately we therefore have no understanding of how these different processes are related when they underlie the same collective decision making event here we consider the whole departure process of two groups of tonkean macaques macaca tonkeana using a stochastic model when several exclusive choices are proposed macaques vote and choose the majority individuals then join the movement according to a mimetism based on affiliative relationships the pre departure quorum and the joining mimetic mechanism are probably linked but we have not yet identified which transition mechanism is used this study shows that decision making related to macaque group movements is governed by a quorum rule combined with a selective mimetism at departure this is the first time that transition mechanisms have been described in mammals which consequently helps understand how a voting process leads to social amplification our study also provides the first complete proof that there is continuity in the decision making processes underlying collective movements in mammals from the first intention movement right through to the last joiner
the influence of the nasal mucosa and the carotid rete upon hypothalamic temperature in sheep ||||| in chronically prepared sheep intracranial temperatures were measured in the cavernous sinus among the vessels of the carotid rete and at the circle of willis extravascularly and in the preoptic area and in other brain stem regions extracranial temperatures were measured intravascularly in the carotid or internal maxillary arteries and on the nasal mucosa and the skin of the ear
a novel stiffening factor inducing the stiffest state of holothurian catch connective tissue ||||| summary the dermis of sea cucumbers is a catch connective tissue or mutable collagenous tissue that shows large changes in stiffness extensive studies on the dermis revealed that it can adopt three different states having different mechanical properties that can be reversibly converted these are the stiff standard and soft states the standard state is readily produced when a dermal piece is immersed in the sea water containing ca whereas the soft state can be produced by removal of ca a stiffening protein tensilin has been isolated from some sea cucumbers cucumaria frondosa and holothuria leucospilota although tensilin converts the state of the dermis from soft to standard it cannot convert from standard to stiff in this study we isolated and partially purified a novel stiffening factor from the dermis of holothuria leucospilota the factor stiffened the dermis in normal artificial sea water asw but did not stiffen the soft dermis in ca free asw it also stiffened the dermis that had been converted to the standard state in ca free asw by the action of tensilin these results suggest that the factor produces the stiff dermis from the standard state but cannot work as a stiffener on the soft dermis its addition to longitudinal muscles of the sea cucumber produced no effects suggesting that its effect is specific to the catch connective tissue its stiffening activity was susceptible to trypsin meaning that it is a polypeptide and its molecular mass estimated from gel filtration chromatography was kda
an excitable gene regulatory circuit induces transient cellular differentiation ||||| certain types of cellular differentiation are probabilistic and transient in such systems individual cells can switch to an alternative state and after some time switch back again in bacillus subtilis competence is an example of such a transiently differentiated state associated with the capability for dna uptake from the environment individual genes and proteins underlying differentiation into the competent state have been identified but it has been unclear how these genes interact dynamically in individual cells to control both spontaneous entry into competence and return to vegetative growth here we show that this behaviour can be understood in terms of excitability in the underlying genetic circuit using quantitative fluorescence time lapse microscopy we directly observed the activities of multiple circuit components simultaneously in individual cells and analysed the resulting data in terms of a mathematical model we find that an excitable core module containing positive and negative feedback loops can explain both entry into and exit from the competent state we further tested this model by analysing initiation in sister cells and by re engineering the gene circuit to specifically block exit excitable dynamics driven by noise naturally generate stochastic and transient responses thereby providing an ideal mechanism for competence regulation
heat transfer through penguin feathers ||||| morphological measurements of penguin feathers are used to construct a thermal model of heat transfer through the coat assuming uniform distribution of the feathers and their associated afterfeathers it is possible to model heat transfer through the coat of the penguin using standard theory it is shown that convection does not occur in the coat of the penguin and that radiative heat loss is minimized the theory predicts a thermal conductivity of w m k which compares well with an empirically measured value of w m k copyright academic press
metal reduction kinetics in shewanella ||||| motivation metal reduction kinetics have been studied in cultures of dissimilatory metal reducing bacteria which include the shewanella oneidensis strain mr estimation of system parameters from time series data faces obstructions in the implementation depending on the choice of the mathematical model that captures the observed dynamics the modeling of metal reduction is often based on michaelis menten equations these models are often developed using initial in vitro reaction rates and seldom match with in vivo reduction profiles results for metal reduction studies we propose a model that is based on the power law representation that is effectively applied to the kinetics of metal reduction the method yields reasonable parameter estimates and is illustrated with the analysis of time series data that describes the dynamics of metal reduction in s oneidensis strain mr in addition mixed metal studies involving the reduction of uranyl u vi to the relatively insoluble tetravalent form u iv by s alga strain br y were studied in the presence of environmentally relevant iron hydrous oxides for mixed metals parameter estimation and curve fitting are accomplished with a generalized least squares formulation that handles systems of ordinary differential equations and is implemented in matlab it consists of an optimization algorithm levenberg marquardt lsqcurvefit and a numerical ode solver simulation with the estimated parameters indicates that the model captures the experimental data quite well the model uses the estimated parameters to predict the reduction rates of metals and mixed metals at varying concentrations supplementary information supplementary data are available at bioinformatics online
current challenges in traditional design verification and its application in flip chip devices ||||| the acceleration of new developments in semiconductor design and manufacturing technology in keeping up with moore s law has introduced significant new challenges for device designers as well as manufacturing organizations short channel effects multi level interconnect cross talk problems and new materials such as low k dielectric copper and silicon on insulator have made modeling and simulation of semiconductor devices and processes extremely difficult many times this results in failure to meet performance targets in first silicon introduction the high cost of mask sets together with the opportunity costs related to time to market drives the need for shorter and fewer redesign cycles making effective transistor level design debug a necessity to make things even more difficult the transition to flip chip packaging and multiple interconnect metal layers makes backside probing the only effective way to perform node level analysis this paper describes these new challenges in detail and the use of photon probing technology as an effective way to address them the use of a time resolved photon emission microscope allows measuring performance at the critical node level this is done by collecting the photons emitted by carriers that are accelerated in the pinch off region during cmos transistor switching this enables optimization of device speed paths and resolution of problems such as race conditions and contentions encountered during design debug and failure analysis cycles
carbon storage in us wetlands ||||| wetland soils contain some of the highest stores of soil carbon in the biosphere however there is little understanding of the quantity and distribution of carbon stored in our remaining wetlands or of the potential effects of human disturbance on these stocks here we use field data from the national wetland condition assessment to provide unbiased estimates of soil carbon stocks for wetlands at regional and national scales we find that wetlands in the conterminous united states store a total of pgc much of which is within soils deeper than cm freshwater inland wetlands in part due to their substantial areal extent hold nearly ten fold more carbon than tidal saltwater sites indicating their importance in regional carbon storage our data suggest a possible relationship between carbon stocks and anthropogenic disturbance these data highlight the need to protect wetlands to mitigate the risk of avoidable contributions to climate change
mosquito proboscis an elegant biomicroelectromechanical system ||||| the mouthparts of female mosquitoes have evolved to form a special proboscis a natural biomicroelectromechanical system bmems which is used for painlessly penetrating human skin and sucking blood scanning electron microscope observations show that the mosquito proboscis consists of a small bundle of long tapering and feeding stylets that are collectively called the fascicle and a large scaly outer lower lip called the labium during blood feeding only the fascicle penetrates into the skin while the labium buckles back to remain on the surface of the skin here we measured the dynamic force of penetration of the fascicle into human skin to reveal the mechanical principle underlying the painless process of penetration high speed video observations of movements associated with insertion of the fascicle indicate that the smart mosquito does not directly pierce its victim s skin with the fascicle instead it uses the two maxillas as variable frequency microsaws with nanosharp teeth to advance into the skin tissue this elegant bmems enables the mosquito to insert its feeding fascicle into human skin using an exceedingly small force average of mn

a nonprotein thermal hysteresis producing xylomannan antifreeze in the freeze tolerant alaskan beetle upis ceramboides ||||| thermal hysteresis th a difference between the melting and freezing points of a solution that is indicative of the presence of large molecular mass antifreezes e g antifreeze proteins has been described in animals plants bacteria and fungi although all previously described th producing biomolecules are proteins most thermal hysteresis factors thfs have not yet been structurally characterized and none have been characterized from a freeze tolerant animal we isolated a highly active thf from the freeze tolerant beetle upis ceramboides by means of ice affinity amino acid chromatographic analysis polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis uv vis spectrophotometry and nmr spectroscopy indicated that the thf contained little or no protein yet it produced degc of th at mg ml comparable to that of the most active insect antifreeze proteins compositional and structural analyses indicated that this antifreeze contains a b mannopyranosyl b xylopyranose backbone and a fatty acid component although the lipid may not be covalently linked to the saccharide consistent with the proposed structure treatment with endo b xylanase ablated th activity this xylomannan is the first th producing antifreeze isolated from a freeze tolerant animal and the first in a new class of highly active thfs that contain little or no protein
starling flock networks manage uncertainty in consensus at low cost ||||| flocks of starlings exhibit a remarkable ability to maintain cohesion as a group in highly uncertain environments and with limited noisy information recent work demonstrated that individual starlings within large flocks respond to a fixed number of nearest neighbors but until now it was not understood why this number is seven we analyze robustness to uncertainty of consensus in empirical data from multiple starling flocks and show that the flock interaction networks with six or seven neighbors optimize the trade off between group cohesion and individual effort we can distinguish these numbers of neighbors from fewer or greater numbers using our systems theoretic approach to measuring robustness of interaction networks as a function of the network structure i e who is sensing whom the metric quantifies the disagreement within the network due to disturbances and noise during consensus behavior and can be evaluated over a parameterized family of hypothesized sensing strategies here the parameter is number of neighbors we use this approach to further show that for the range of flocks studied the optimal number of neighbors does not depend on the number of birds within a flock rather it depends on the shape notably the thickness of the flock the results suggest that robustness to uncertainty may have been a factor in the evolution of flocking for starlings more generally our results elucidate the role of the interaction network on uncertainty management in collective behavior and motivate the application of our approach to other biological networks
molecular mechanisms of synovial joint lubrication ||||| abstract current models for lubrication of synovial joints and the nature of the cartilage surface are briefly recalled direct friction studies between polymers attached to surfaces are then considered particularly the very recent demonstration of extreme friction reduction enabled by hydrated ions and by charged polymers it is proposed that the extremely efficient lubrication observed in living joints arises from the presence of a brush like phase of charged macromolecules at the surface of the superficial zone this phase forms when charged macromolecules including lubricin superficial zone protein and aggrecan cross the interface between the superficial zone and the synovial cavity as they are secreted into the synovium from within the bulk of the cartilage and in particular the feasibility of such brush like surface phases is examined in some detail the molecular mechanisms for the reduction in friction are proposed to be similar to those recently revealed using surface force balance studies on lubrication by charged brushes
quorum sensing and social networking in the microbial world ||||| for many years bacterial cells were considered primarily as selfish individuals but in recent years it has become evident that far from operating in isolation they coordinate collective behaviour in response to environmental challenges using sophisticated intercellular communication networks cell to cell communication between bacteria is mediated by small diffusible signal molecules that trigger changes in gene expression in response to fluctuations in population density this process generally referred to as quorum sensing qs controls diverse phenotypes in numerous gram positive and gram negative bacteria recent advances have revealed that bacteria are not limited to communication within their own species but are capable of listening in and broadcasting to unrelated species to intercept messages and coerce cohabitants into behavioural modifications either for the good of the population or for the benefit of one species over another it is also evident that qs is not limited to the bacterial kingdom the study of two way intercellular signalling networks between bacteria and both uni and multicellular eukaryotes as well as between eukaryotes is just beginning to unveil a rich diversity of communication pathways
biologically induced reduction in symmetry a study of crystal texture of calcitic sponge spicules ||||| organisms can exert a remark able degree of control over crystal growth one way of achieving this is by the ad sorption of specialized macromolecules on specific planes of the growing crystals with continued growth of the crystal the macromolecules are incorporated inside the crystal bulk their presence does not change the crystal structure but creates discontinuities in the perfect lattice here we study in detail three unusual cases of reduction in symmetry at the level of crys tal domain shapes induced by this con trolled intercalation we examined sponge spicules which are single crystals of mg bearing calcite they were specifically chosen for this study because their mor phologies do not reflect the hexagonal symmetry of calcite their crystal textures coherence lengths and angular spreads were characterized by high resolution x ray diffraction with well collimated syn chrotron radiation the results are com pared to analogous studies of synthetic calcite and mg bearing calcite in all the selected spicules reduction in symmetry is observed in the coherence lengths among symmetry related crystallographic direc tions the reconstructed shapes of the do mains of perfect structure closely match the specific spicule morphologies the synthetic crystals show no such reduction in symmetry although the manner by which such exquisite control is achieved is not known we envisage it involving a combination of oriented nucleation with either physical or stereochemically driven adsorption
hydrogen is an energy source for hydrothermal vent symbioses ||||| the discovery of deep sea hydrothermal vents in revolutionized our understanding of the energy sources that fuel primary productivity on earth hydrothermal vent ecosystems are dominated by animals that live in symbiosis with chemosynthetic bacteria so far only two energy sources have been shown to power chemosynthetic symbioses reduced sulphur compounds and methane using metagenome sequencing single gene fluorescence in situ hybridization immunohistochemistry shipboard incubations and in situ mass spectrometry we show here that the symbionts of the hydrothermal vent mussel bathymodiolus from the mid atlantic ridge use hydrogen to power primary production in addition we show that the symbionts of bathymodiolus mussels from pacific vents have hupl the key gene for hydrogen oxidation furthermore the symbionts of other vent animals such as the tubeworm riftia pachyptila and the shrimp rimicaris exoculata also have hupl we propose that the ability to use hydrogen as an energy source is widespread in hydrothermal vent symbioses particularly at sites where hydrogen is abundant
death by small forces a fracture and fatigue analysis of wave swept macroalgae ||||| summary wave swept macroalgae are subjected to large hydrodynamic forces as each wave breaks on shore loads that are repeated thousands of times per day previous studies have shown that macroalgae can easily withstand isolated impositions of maximal field forces nonetheless macroalgae break frequently here we investigate the possibility that repeated loading by sub lethal forces can eventually cause fracture by fatigue we determine fracture toughness in the form of critical strain energy release rate for several flat bladed macroalgae thereby assessing their resistance to complete fracture in the presence of cracks critical energy release rates are evaluated through single edge notch pull to break tests and single edge notch repeated loading tests crack growth at sub critical energy release rates is measured in repeated loading tests providing a first assessment of algal breakage under conditions of repeated loading we then estimate the number of imposed waves required for un notched algal blades to reach the point of complete fracture we find that if not checked by repair fatigue crack growth from repeated sub lethal stresses may completely fracture individuals within days our results suggest that fatigue may play an important role in macroalgal breakage
desert locust gregarization a conceptual kinetic model ||||| abstract a better understanding of the mechanisms that underlie phase transformation in a solitarious desert locust population is an important prerequisite for the development of a quantitative gregarization model and for predicting locust outbreaks two types of processes are involved clustering at diminishing spatial scales which brings dispersed locusts together and which in patchy micro environments with a concentrated food resource gives rise to nuclei of pheromone emitting gregarizing insects and recruitment processes which promote the horizontal spread of gregarious traits from such nuclei because of the heterogeneity of typical breeding habitats and divergent behavior of the phases of the insect there is a dynamic interplay between the forces of crowd formation and those of dispersal all the key steps in the course of phase change are reversible and for successful development of a viable gregarious population all must proceed at optimal pace toward the gregarious phase the process resembles a chemical transformation that involves a series of reversible sequential steps and may likewise be treated as a series of equilibria such a conceptual model may constitute a useful framework for quantitative studies in desert locust primary breeding areas and in the development of a predictive gregarization model
fracture toughness of locust cuticle ||||| summary insect cuticle is one of the most common biological materials yet very little is known about its mechanical properties many parts of the insect exoskeleton such as the jumping legs of locusts have to withstand high and repeated loading without failure this paper presents the first measurements of fracture toughness for insect cuticle using a standard engineering approach our results show that the fracture toughness of cuticle in locust hind legs is mpa m and decreases with desiccation of the cuticle stiffness and strength of the tibia cuticle were measured using buckling and cantilever bending and increased with desiccation a combination of the cuticle s high toughness with a relatively low stiffness of gpa results in a work of fracture of kj m which is amongst the highest of any biological material giving the insect leg an exceptional ability to tolerate defects such as cracks and damage interestingly insect cuticle achieves these unique properties without using reinforcement by a mineral phase which is often found in other biological composite materials these findings thus might inspire the development of new biomimetic composite materials
biodeterioration of crude oil and oil derived products a review ||||| biodeterioration of crude oil and oil fuels is a serious economic and an environmental problem all over the world it is impossible to prevent penetration of microorganisms in oil and fuels both stored in tanks or in oilfields after drilling both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms tend to colonise oil pipelines and oil and fuel storage installations complex microbial communities consisting of both hydrocarbon oxidizing microorganisms and bacteria using the metabolites of the former form an ecological niche where they thrive the accumulation of water at the bottom of storage tanks and in oil pipelines is a primary prerequisite for development of microorganisms in fuels and oil and their subsequent biological fouling ability of microorganisms to grow both in a water phase and on inter phase of water hydrocarbon as well as the generation of products of their metabolism worsen the physical and chemical properties of oils and fuels this activity also increases the amount of suspended solids leads to the formation of slimes and creates a variety of operational problems nowadays various test systems are utilized for microbial monitoring in crude oils and fuels thus allowing an express determination of both the species and the quantities of microorganisms present to suppress microbial growth in oils and fuels both physico mechanical and chemical methods are applied among chemical methods the preference is given to substances such as biocides additives the anti freezing agents etc that do not deteriorate the quality of oil and fuels and are environmentally friendly this review is devoted to the analysis of the present knowledge in the field of microbial fouling of crude oils and oil products the methods utilized for monitoring of microbial contamination and prevention of their undesirable activities are also evaluated the special focus is given to russian scientific literature devoted to crude oil and oil products biodeterioration
why do pigeon feathers repel water hydrophobicity of pennae cassie baxter wetting hypothesis and cassie wenzel capillarity induced wetting transition ||||| wetting of pigeon feathers has been studied it was demonstrated that the cassie baxter wetting regime is inherent for pigeon pennae the water drop supported by network formed by barbs and barbules sits partially on air pockets small static apparent angle hysteresis justifies the cassie baxter wetting hypothesis a twofold structure of a feather favors large contact angles and provides its water repellency cassie wenzel transition has been observed under drop evaporation when drop radius becomes small enough for capillarity induced water penetration into the protrusions formed by barbules
biochemical analysis of elastic and rigid cuticles of cirsium horridulum ||||| abstract the cuticle is a complex structure of soluble lipids lipid polymers and polysaccharides in addition to its functions to reduce water loss and provide a protective barrier its mechanical properties may be significant to plant growth and development we investigated the cuticle of cirsium horridulum michx because of its involvement in the thigmonastic contraction of staminal filaments the staminal filaments and portions of the style are surrounded by a highly elastic cuticle in contrast to the rigid cuticle of the corolla and leaves our aim was to determine if the biochemical composition affected the elasticity of the cuticle we discovered that the ratio of carbohydrates to lipids is in floral parts but in leaf cuticle esterified cutin components represented about of the cuticle and di hydroxyhexadecanoic acids were the major monomers of cutin regardless of origin the cutin of elastic tissues is characterized by a higher content of tri hydroxy monomers than the cutin of rigid tissues the data suggest that hydroxyl groups enhance the hydrophilic character of the cuticle and contribute to cuticular elasticity
biosensing of opioids using frog melanophores ||||| spectacular color changes of fishes frogs and other lower vertebrates are due to the motile activities of specialized pigment containing cells pigment cells are interesting for biosensing purposes since they provide an easily monitored physiological phenomenon melanophores containing dark brown melanin pigment granules constitute an important class of chromatophores their melanin filled pigment granules may be stimulated to undergo rapid dispersion throughout the melanophores cells appear dark or aggregation to the center of the melanophores cells appear light this simple physiological response can easily be measured in a photometer selected g protein coupled receptors can be functionally expressed in cultured frog melanophores here we demonstrate the use of recombinant frog melanophores as a biosensor for the detection of opioids melanophores were transfected with the human opioid receptor and used for opiate detection the response to the opioid receptor agonist morphine and a synthetic opioid peptide was analyzed by absorbance readings in an aggregation assay it was shown that both agonists caused aggregation of pigment granules in the melanophores and the cells appeared lighter the pharmacology of the expressed receptors was very similar to its mammalian counterpart as evidenced by competitive inhibition by increasing concentrations of the opioid receptor inhibitor naloxone transfection of melanophores with selected receptors enables the creation of numerous melanophore biosensors which respond selectively to certain substances the melanophore biosensor has potential use for measurement of substances in body fluids such as saliva blood plasma and urine
membrane thickness cue for cold sensing in a bacterium ||||| thermosensors are ubiquitous integral membrane proteins found in all kinds of life they are involved in many physiological roles including membrane remodeling chemotaxis touch and pain but the mechanism by which their transmembrane tm domains transmit temperature signals is largely unknown the histidine kinase desk from bacillus subtilis is the paradigmatic example of a membrane bound thermosensor suited to remodel membrane fluidity when the temperature drops below approximately degc providing thus a tractable system for investigating the mechanism of tm mediated input output control of thermal adaptation here we show that the multimembrane spanning domain from desk can be simplified into a chimerical single membrane spanning minimal sensor ms that fully retains in vivo and in vitro the sensing properties of the parental system the ms n terminus contains three hydrophilic amino acids near the lipid water interface creating an instability hot spot mutational analysis of this boundary sensitive beacon revealed that membrane thickness controls the signaling state of the sensor by dictating the hydration level of the metastable hydrophilic spot guided by these results we biochemically demonstrated that the ms signal transmission activity is sensitive to bilayer thickness membrane thickness could be a general cue for sensing temperature in many organisms
the narrow leaf syndrome a functional and evolutionary approach to the form of fog harvesting rosette plants ||||| plants that use fog as an important water source frequently have a rosette growth habit the performance of this morphology in relation to fog interception has not been studied some first principles from physics predict that narrow leaves together with other ancillary traits large number and high flexibility of leaves caudices and or epiphytism which constitute the narrow leaf syndrome should increase fog interception efficiency this was tested using aluminum models of rosettes that differed in leaf length width and number and were exposed to artificial fog the results were validated using seven species of tillandsia and four species of xerophytic rosettes the total amount of fog intercepted in rosette plants increased with total leaf area while narrow leaves maximized interception efficiency measured as interception per unit area the number of leaves in the rosettes is physically constrained because wide leafed plants can only have a few blades at the limits of this constraint net fog interception was independent of leaf form but interception efficiency was maximized by large numbers of narrow leaves atmospheric tillandsia species show the narrow leaf syndrome their fog interception efficiencies were correlated to the ones predicted from aluminum model data in the larger xerophytic rosette species the interception efficiency was greatest in plants showing the narrow leaf syndrome the adaptation to fog harvesting in several narrow leaved rosettes was tested for evolutionary convergence in xerophytic rosette species using a comparative method there was a significant evolutionary tendency towards the development of the narrow leaf syndrome the closer the species grew to areas where fog is frequently available this study establishes convergence in a very wide group of plants encompassing genera as contrasting as tillandsia and agave as a result of their dependence on fog
the anatomy and ultrastructure of the suctorial organ of solifugae arachnida ||||| solifugae possess an evertable adhesive pedipalpal organ suctorial organ at the tip of the distal tarsus of each pedipalp that is unique among arachnids when inverted inside the pedipalp the suctorial organ is covered with two cuticular lips a dorsal upper lip and a ventral lower lip but it can be protruded rapidly in order to facilitate grasping prey or climbing on bushes or even climbing on smooth surfaces due to its remarkable adhesive properties in this study the suctorial organs of different species from old world families galeodidae and karschiidae and new world families ammotrechidae and eremobatidae were investigated by means of light microscopy scanning and transmission electron microscopy in all representatives the suctorial organ is formed by an evertable cuticular pad with a complex internal stabilizing structure the procuticle of this pad consists of a lattice like basal plate and numerous stalked structures connected to this basal plate the shafts of the stalked structures are regularly organized and ramify apically the surface of the suctorial organ is constituted of a very thin epicuticle overlaying the ramifying apices forming ridges and furrows on the ventral side of the suctorial organ
squalamine as a broad spectrum systemic antiviral agent with therapeutic potential ||||| antiviral compounds that increase the resistance of host tissues represent an attractive class of therapeutic here we show that squalamine a compound previously isolated from the tissues of the dogfish shark squalus acanthias and the sea lamprey petromyzon marinus exhibits broad spectrum antiviral activity against human pathogens which were studied in vitro as well as in vivo both rna and dna enveloped viruses are shown to be susceptible the proposed mechanism involves the capacity of squalamine a cationic amphipathic sterol to neutralize the negative electrostatic surface charge of intracellular membranes in a way that renders the cell less effective in supporting viral replication because squalamine can be readily synthesized and has a known safety profile in man we believe its potential as a broad spectrum human antiviral agent should be explored
evidence for self cleaning in gecko setae ||||| a tokay gecko can cling to virtually any surface and support its body mass with a single toe by using the millions of keratinous setae on its toe pads each seta branches into hundreds of nm spatulae that make intimate contact with a variety of surface profiles we showed previously that the combined surface area of billions of spatulae maximizes van der waals interactions to generate large adhesive and shear forces geckos are not known to groom their feet yet retain their stickiness for months between molts how geckos manage to keep their feet clean while walking about with sticky toes has remained a puzzle until now although self cleaning by water droplets occurs in plant and animal surfaces no adhesive has been shown to self clean in the present study we demonstrate that gecko setae are a self cleaning adhesive geckos with dirty feet recovered their ability to cling to vertical surfaces after only a few steps self cleaning occurred in arrays of setae isolated from the gecko contact mechanical models suggest that self cleaning occurs by an energetic disequilibrium between the adhesive forces attracting a dirt particle to the substrate and those attracting the same particle to one or more spatulae we propose that the property of self cleaning is intrinsic to the setal nanostructure and therefore should be replicable in synthetic adhesive materials in the future
alteration of north american streams by beaver ||||| organic matter in the channel create and maintain wetlands modify nutrient cycling and decomposition dynamics modify the structure and dynamics of the riparian zone influence the character of water and materials transported downstream and ultimately influence plant and animal community composition and diversity naiman and melillo naiman et al in addition to their importance at the ecosystem level these effects have a significant impact on the landscape and must be interpreted over broad spatial and temporal scales as beaver population dynamics shift in response to disturbance food supply disease and predation although once more prevalent than they are today beaver induced alterations to drainage networks are not localized or unusual where beaver

insect eggs protected from high temperatures by limited homeothermy of plant leaves ||||| summary virtually all aspects of insect biology are affected by body temperature and many taxa have evolved sophisticated temperature control mechanisms all insects however begin life as eggs and lack the ability to thermoregulate eggs laid on leaves experience a thermal environment and thus a body temperature that is strongly influenced by the leaves themselves because plants can maintain leaf temperatures that differ from ambient e g by evapotranspiration plant hosts may protect eggs from extreme ambient temperatures we examined the degree to which leaves buffer ambient thermal variation and whether that buffering benefits leaf associated insect eggs in particular we measured temperature variation at oviposition sites in the field manipulated temperatures in the laboratory to determine the effect of different thermal conditions on embryo development time and survival and tested embryonic metabolic rates over increasing temperatures our results show that datura wrightii leaves buffer manduca sexta eggs from fatally high ambient temperatures in the southwestern usa moreover small differences in temperature profiles among leaves can cause large variation in egg metabolic rate and development time specifically large leaves were hotter than small leaves during the day reaching temperatures that are stressfully high for eggs this study provides the first mechanistic demonstration of how this type of leaf constructed thermal refuge interacts with egg physiology
finite element modeling of shell shape in the freshwater turtle pseudemys concinna reveals a trade off between mechanical strength and hydrodynamic efficiency ||||| aquatic species can experience different selective pressures on morphology in different flow regimes species inhabiting lotic regimes often adapt to these conditions by evolving low drag i e streamlined morphologies that reduce the likelihood of dislodgment or displacement however hydrodynamic factors are not the only selective pressures influencing organismal morphology and shapes well suited to flow conditions may compromise performance in other roles we investigated the possibility of morphological trade offs in the turtle pseudemys concinna individuals living in lotic environments have flatter more streamlined shells than those living in lentic environments however this flatter shape may also make the shells less capable of resisting predator induced loads we tested the idea that lotic shell shapes are weaker than lentic shell shapes concomitantly examining effects of sex geometric morphometric data were used to transform an existing finite element shell model into a series of models corresponding to the shapes of individual turtles models were assigned identical material properties and loaded under identical conditions and the stresses produced by a series of eight loads were extracted to describe the strength of the shells lotic shell shapes produced significantly higher stresses than lentic shell shapes indicating that the former is weaker than the latter females had significantly stronger shell shapes than males although these differences were less consistent than differences between flow regimes we conclude that despite the potential for many to one mapping of shell shape onto strength p concinna experiences a trade off in shell shape between hydrodynamic and mechanical performance this trade off may be evident in many other turtle species or any other aquatic species that also depend on a shell for defense however evolution of body size may provide an avenue of escape from this trade off in some cases as changes in size can drastically affect mechanical performance while having little effect on hydrodynamic performance j morphol c wiley liss inc
extreme resistance of bdelloid rotifers to ionizing radiation ||||| rotifers of class bdelloidea are common invertebrate animals with highly unusual characteristics including apparently obligate asexuality the ability to resume reproduction after desiccation at any life stage and a paucity of transposable genetic elements of types not prone to horizontal transmission we find that bdelloids are also extraordinarily resistant to ionizing radiation ir reproduction of the bdelloids adineta vaga and philodina roseola is much more resistant to ir than that of euchlanis dilatata a rotifer belonging to the desiccation intolerant and facultatively sexual class monogononta and all other animals for which we have found relevant data by analogy with the desiccation and radiation resistant bacterium deinococcus radiodurans we suggest that the extraordinary radiation resistance of bdelloid rotifers is a consequence of their evolutionary adaptation to survive episodes of desiccation encountered in their characteristic habitats and that the damage incurred in such episodes includes dna breakage that is repaired upon rehydration such breakage and repair may have maintained bdelloid chromosomes as colinear pairs and kept the load of transposable genetic elements low and may also have contributed to the success of bdelloid rotifers in avoiding the early extinction suffered by most asexuals
a role for parasites in stabilising the fig pollinator mutualism ||||| mutualisms are interspecific interactions in which both players benefit explaining their maintenance is problematic because cheaters should outcompete cooperative conspecifics leading to mutualism instability monoecious figs ficus are pollinated by host specific wasps agaonidae whose larvae gall ovules in their fruits syconia female pollinating wasps oviposit directly into ficus ovules from inside the receptive syconium across ficus species there is a widely documented segregation of pollinator galls in inner ovules and seeds in outer ovules this pattern suggests that wasps avoid or are prevented from ovipositing into outer ovules and this results in mutualism stability however the mechanisms preventing wasps from exploiting outer ovules remain unknown we report that in ficus rubiginosa offspring in outer ovules are vulnerable to attack by parasitic wasps that oviposit from outside the syconium parasitism risk decreases towards the centre of the syconium where inner ovules provide enemy free space for pollinator offspring we suggest that the resulting gradient in offspring viability is likely to contribute to selection on pollinators to avoid outer ovules and by forcing wasps to focus on a subset of ovules reduces their galling rates this previously unidentified mechanism may therefore contribute to mutualism persistence independent of additional factors that invoke plant defences against pollinator oviposition or physiological constraints on pollinators that prevent oviposition in all available ovules
mediation of pyrethroid insecticide toxicity to honey bees hymenoptera apidae by cytochrome p monooxygenases ||||| honey bees apis mellifera l often thought to be extremely susceptible to insecticides in general exhibit considerable variation in tolerance to pyrethroid insecticides although some pyrethroids such as cyfluthrin and lambda cyhalothrin are highly toxic to honey bees the toxicity of tau fluvalinate is low enough to warrant its use to control parasitic mites inside honey bee colonies metabolic insecticide resistance in other insects is mediated by three major groups of detoxifying enzymes the cytochrome p monooxygenases p s the carboxylesterases coes and the glutathione s transferases gsts to test the role of metabolic detoxification in mediating the relatively low toxicity of tau fluvalinate compared with more toxic pyrethroid insecticides we examined the effects of piperonyl butoxide pbo s s s tributylphosphorotrithioate def and diethyl maleate dem on the toxicity of these pyrethroids the toxicity of the three pyrethroids to bees was greatly synergized by the p inhibitor pbo and synergized at low levels by the carboxylesterase inhibitor def little synergism was observed with dem these results suggest that metabolic detoxification especially that mediated by p s contributes significantly to honey bee tolerance of pyrethroid insecticides the potent synergism between tau fluvalinate and pbo suggests that p s are especially important in the detoxification of this pyrethroid and explains the ability of honey bees to tolerate its presence
co mineralization induced by fungal nitrate assimilation ||||| formation of caco induced by fungal physiological activities is a potential way to sequestrate atmospheric co in ecosystem alternaria sp is a saprophytic fungus isolated from a forest soil we examined the precipitation of caco induced by the fungus in response to different levels of ca no or cacl in agar media and the biogenesis of caco was verified by low d c value the formed caco was identified as calcite by x ray diffraction analysis square rectangular and rhombic caco crystals and amorphous calcium carbonate were observed around mycelia at higher levels of ca no acidification occurred in media at low concentrations and m of ca no and no caco formed in these media the quantities of caco formed in media increased with increasing concentrations of ca no and were significantly correlated to fungal biomass ph value and nitrite concentrations no caco was formed in media with cacl at all levels these results collectively indicated that the formation of caco can be induced by the fungal assimilation of nitrate the study also revealed that biogenic crystal of caco tended to grow on a silicon nucleus and the amorphous calcium carbonate acc was the transient stage of caco crystal
a visual pathway links brain structures active during magnetic compass orientation in migratory birds ||||| the magnetic compass of migratory birds has been suggested to be light dependent retinal cryptochrome expressing neurons and a forebrain region cluster n show high neuronal activity when night migratory songbirds perform magnetic compass orientation by combining neuronal tracing with behavioral experiments leading to sensory driven gene expression of the neuronal activity marker zenk during magnetic compass orientation we demonstrate a functional neuronal connection between the retinal neurons and cluster n via the visual thalamus thus the two areas of the central nervous system being most active during magnetic compass orientation are part of an ascending visual processing stream the thalamofugal pathway furthermore cluster n seems to be a specialized part of the visual wulst these findings strongly support the hypothesis that migratory birds use their visual system to perceive the reference compass direction of the geomagnetic field and that migratory birds see the reference compass direction provided by the geomagnetic field
cryo em model of the bullet shaped vesicular stomatitis virus ||||| vsv in d rhabdoviruses are a family of negative stranded rna viruses that includes rabies virus which have a characteristic bullet shape though structures of individual rhabdovirus proteins have been reported how these are organized into a bullet shape has remained unclear now ge et al p report a cryo electron microscopy structure of a model rhabdovirus vesicular stomatitis virus the structural data and examination of mutants allows modeling of virion assembly the structure of a negative strand rna virus suggests how bullet shaped rhabdoviruses assemble vesicular stomatitis virus vsv is a bullet shaped rhabdovirus and a model system of negative strand rna viruses through direct visualization by means of cryo electron microscopy we show that each virion contains two nested left handed helices an outer helix of matrix protein m and an inner helix of nucleoprotein n and rna m has a hub domain with four contact sites that link to neighboring m and n subunits providing rigidity by clamping adjacent turns of the nucleocapsid side by side interactions between neighboring n subunits are critical for the nucleocapsid to form a bullet shape and structure based mutagenesis results support this description together our data suggest a mechanism of vsv assembly in which the nucleocapsid spirals from the tip to become the helical trunk both subsequently framed and rigidified by the m layer
the sandfish s skin morphology chemistry and reconstruction ||||| the sandfish is a lizard having the remarkable ability to move in desert sand in a swimming like fashion the most outstanding adaptations to this mode of life are the low friction behaviour and the extensive abrasion resistance of the sandfish skin against sand outperforming even steel we investigated the topography the composition and the mechanical properties of sandfish scales these consist of glycosylated keratins with high amount of sulphur but no hard inorganic material such as silicates or lime remarkably atomic force microscopy shows an almost complete absence of attractive forces between the scale surface and a silicon tip suggesting that this is responsible for the unusual tribological properties the unusual glycosylation of the keratins was found to be absolutely necessary for the described phenomenon the scales were dissolved and reconstituted on a polymer surface resulting in properties similar to the original scale thus we provide a pathway towards exploitation of the reconstituted scale material for future engineering applications
sensitivity to dimethyl sulphide suggests a mechanism for olfactory navigation by seabirds ||||| petrels albatrosses and other procellariiform seabirds have an excellent sense of smell and routinely navigate over the world s oceans by mechanisms that are not well understood these birds travel thousands of kilometres to forage on ephemeral prey patches at variable locations yet they can quickly and efficiently find their way back to their nests on remote islands to provision chicks even with magnetic senses experimentally disrupted over the seemingly featureless ocean environment local emissions of scents released by phytoplankton reflect bathymetric features such as shelf breaks and seamounts these features suggest an odour landscape that may provide birds with orientation cues we have previously shown that concentrated experimental deployments of one such compound dimethyl sulphide dms attracts procellariiforms at sea suggesting that some species can use it as a foraging cue here we present the first physiological demonstration that an antarctic seabird can detect dms at biogenic levels we further show that birds can use dms as an orientation cue in a non foraging context within a concentration range that they might naturally encounter over the ocean
the long and short of hearing in the mosquito aedes aegypti ||||| mating behavior in aedes aegypti mosquitoes occurs mid air and involves the exchange of auditory signals at close range millimeters to centimeters it is widely assumed that this intimate signaling distance reflects short range auditory sensitivity of their antennal hearing organs to faint flight tones to the contrary we show here that male mosquitoes can hear the female s flight tone at surprisingly long distances from several meters to up to m and that unrestrained resting ae aegypti males leap off their perches and take flight when they hear female flight tones moreover auditory sensitivity tests of ae aegypti s hearing organ made from neurophysiological recordings of the auditory nerve in response to pure tone stimuli played from a loudspeaker support the behavioral experiments this demonstration of long range hearing in mosquitoes overturns the common assumption that the thread like antennal hearing organs of tiny insects are strictly close range ears the effective range of a hearing organ depends ultimately on its sensitivity here a mosquito s antennal ear is shown to be sensitive to sound levels down to db sound pressure level spl translating to air particle velocity at nanometer dimensions we note that the peak of energy of the first formant of the vowels of the human speech spectrum range from about hz and is typically spoken at db spl together they lie in the sweet spot of mosquito hearing video abstract
microtubule polymerization one step at a time ||||| the dynamic assembly of microtubules is a key factor in many of their functions in the cell and recent experiments give new insight into this process at the molecular level
ontogenetic changes in tracheal structure facilitate deep dives and cold water foraging in adult leatherback sea turtles ||||| summary adult leatherbacks are large animals kg overlapping in size with marine pinniped and cetacean species unlike marine mammals they start their aquatic life as g hatchlings so undergo a fold increase in body mass during independent existence hatchlings are limited to the tropics and near surface water adults obligate predators on gelatinous plankton encounter cold water at depth m or high latitude and are gigantotherms that maintain elevated core body temperatures in cold water this study shows that there are great ontogenetic changes in tracheal structure related to diving and exposure to cold hatchling leatherbacks have a conventional reptilian tracheal structure with circular cartilaginous rings interspersed with extensive connective tissue the adult trachea is an almost continuous ellipsoidal cartilaginous tube composed of interlocking plates and will collapse easily in the upper part of the water column during dives thus avoiding pressure related structural and physiological problems it is lined with an extensive dense erectile vascular plexus that will warm and humidify cold inspired air and possibly retain heat on expiration a sub luminal lymphatic plexus is also present mammals and birds have independently evolved nasal turbinates to fulfil such a respiratory thermocontrol function for them turbinates are regarded as diagnostic of endothermy this is the first demonstration of a turbinate equivalent in a living reptile
adaptive evolution of threonine deaminase in plant defense against insect herbivores ||||| gene duplication is a major source of plant chemical diversity that mediates plant herbivore interactions there is little direct evidence however that novel chemical traits arising from gene duplication reduce herbivory higher plants use threonine deaminase td to catalyze the dehydration of threonine thr to a ketobutyrate and ammonia as the committed step in the biosynthesis of isoleucine ile cultivated tomato and related solanum species contain a duplicated td paralog td that is coexpressed with a suite of genes involved in herbivore resistance analysis of td deficient tomato lines showed that td has a defensive function related to thr catabolism in the gut of lepidopteran herbivores during herbivory the regulatory domain of td is removed by proteolysis to generate a truncated protein ptd that efficiently degrades thr without being inhibited by ile we show that this proteolytic activation step occurs in the gut of lepidopteran but not coleopteran herbivores and is catalyzed by a chymotrypsin like protease of insect origin analysis of purified recombinant enzymes showed that td is remarkably more resistant to proteolysis and high temperature than the ancestral td isoform the crystal structure of ptd provided evidence that electrostatic interactions constitute a stabilizing feature associated with adaptation of td to the extreme environment of the lepidopteran gut these findings demonstrate a role for gene duplication in the evolution of a plant defense that targets and co opts herbivore digestive physiology
fish mucous cocoons the mosquito nets of the sea ||||| mucus performs numerous protective functions in vertebrates and in fishes may defend them against harmful organisms although often the evidence is contradictory the function of the mucous cocoons that many parrotfishes and wrasses sleep in while long used as a classical example of antipredator behaviour remains unresolved ectoparasitic gnathiid isopods gnathiidae which feed on the blood of fish are removed by cleaner fish during the day however it is unclear how parrotfish and wrasse avoid gnathiid attacks at night to test the novel hypothesis that mucous cocoons protect against gnathiids we exposed the coral reef parrotfish chlorurus sordidus scaridae with and without cocoons to gnathiids overnight and measured the energetic content of cocoons fish without mucous cocoons were attacked more by gnathiids than fish with cocoons the energetic content of mucous cocoons was estimated as per cent of the fish s daily energy budget fish therefore mucous cocoons protected against attacks by gnathiids acting like mosquito nets in humans a function of cocoons and an efficient physiological adaptation for preventing parasite infestation that is not used by any other animal
the diving bell and the spider the physical gill of argyroneta aquatica ||||| summary argyroneta aquatica is a unique air breathing spider that lives virtually its entire life under freshwater it creates a dome shaped web between aquatic plants and fills the diving bell with air carried from the surface the bell can take up dissolved o from the water acting as a physical gill by measuring bell volume and o partial pressure po with tiny o sensitive optodes this study showed that the spiders produce physical gills capable of satisfying at least their resting requirements for o under the most extreme conditions of warm stagnant water larger spiders produced larger bells of higher o conductance go go depended on surface area only effective boundary layer thickness was constant bells with and without spiders were used as respirometers by measuring go and the rate of change in po metabolic rates were also measured with flow through respirometry the water air po difference was generally less than kpa and spiders voluntarily tolerated low internal po approximately kpa before renewal with air from the surface the low po in the bell enhanced n loss from the bell but spiders could remain inside for more than a day without renewal spiders appeared to enlarge the bells in response to higher o demands and lower aquatic po
strong ultralight foams based on nanocrystalline cellulose for high performance insulation ||||| environmentally friendly sustainable and high performance thermal insulators are in high demand petroleum based insulator foams usually have high thermal conductivity and pose health hazards here we report ultralight composite foams that are highly strong elastic and super insulating the foams are composed of nanocrystalline cellulose ncc wt polyvinyl alcohol wt and a crosslinking agent wt the fabrication process is simple and uses only water the composite foams exhibit an elastic strain of at a modulus of k pa and a stress of k pa at strain and times respectively higher than those of pure ncc foam both exceed the values of reported nanocellulose based foams with no reinforcement the foams exhibit a thermal conductivity of wm k which is superior to those of traditional insulating materials the structural integrity is also preserved after burning our results show that ncc based materials can be engineered towards high performance insulation applications
the detection of carbonation by the drosophila gustatory system ||||| there are five known taste modalities in humans sweet bitter sour salty and umami the taste of monosodium glutamate although the fruitfly drosophila melanogaster tastes sugars salts and noxious chemicals the nature and number of taste modalities in this organism is not clear previous studies have identified one taste cell population marked by the gustatory receptor gene gr a that detects sugars and a second population marked by gr a that detects bitter compounds here we identify a novel taste modality in this insect the taste of carbonated water we use a combination of anatomical calcium imaging and behavioural approaches to identify a population of taste neurons that detects co and mediates taste acceptance behaviour the taste of carbonation may allow drosophila to detect and obtain nutrients from growing microorganisms whereas co detection by the olfactory system mediates avoidance co detection by the gustatory system mediates acceptance behaviour demonstrating that the context of co determines appropriate behaviour this work opens up the possibility that the taste of carbonation may also exist in other organisms
sensory trap as the mechanism of sexual selection in a damselfly genitalic trait insecta calopterygidae ||||| during copulation males of some calopterygid damselfly species displace the sperm stored in the spermatheca the male genital appendages enter into the spermathecal ducts and physically remove sperm in calopteryx haemorrhoidalis the genital appendages are too wide to penetrate the spermathecae but males use a different mechanism in which the aedeagus stimulates the vaginal sensilla that control spermathecal sperm release since these sensilla are used during egg fertilization and oviposition it was hypothesized that this function evolved before the male stimulatory ability i investigated this using hetaerina cruentata a species whose position in the calopterygidae phylogeny is more basal than calopteryx given this position and having determined that males of this species are not able to displace sperm of their conspecific females during copulation it was expected that h cruentata females would eject sperm when stimulated with the aedeagi of c haemorrhoidalis but not when stimulated with the aedeagi of their conspecifics this prediction was confirmed in order to investigate the widespread nature of this result some other calopteryx species calopteryx xanthostoma and calopteryx virgo were investigated the results were similar to those of h cruentata conspecific males were unable to stimulate their females but females ejected sperm when stimulated with c haemorrhoidalis aedeagi morphometric analysis suggests that the mechanistic explanation for the stimulatory ability of c haemorrhoidalis genitalia is that the aedeagal region that makes contact with the vaginal sensilla is wider in c haemorrhoidalis than in the other species these results suggest that the sensory bias shown and shared by h cruentata calopteryx splendens c virgo and c haemorrhoidalis females represents an ancestral condition and that the male stimulatory ability is absent in the evolutionary history of the clade these pieces of evidence as well as another one presented elsewhere which indicates that c haemorrhoidalis males vary in their stimulatory ability constitute the three criteria for a case of sexual selection via exploitation of a female sensory bias these results also provide support to the sensory trap hypothesis that indicates that the female bias in this case egg fertilization and oviposition evolved in a context different from sexual selection considering that the male genital appendages responsible for physically removing spermathecal sperm in other calopterygids are present in c haemorrhoidalis i suggest that males were once able to displace spermathecal sperm physically such ability may have been later impeded by a reduction in size of the spermathecal ducts possibly one of the latest events in this sequence is the male s stimulatory ability this hypothetical series of events suggests a coevolutionary scenario in which the central actor is the sperm stored in the spermathecae
trabecular bone scales allometrically in mammals and birds ||||| many bones are supported internally by a latticework of trabeculae scaling of whole bone length and diameter has been extensively investigated but scaling of the trabecular network is not well characterized we analysed trabecular geometry in the femora of terrestrial mammalian and avian species with body masses ranging from g to kg we found that bone volume fraction does not scale substantially with animal size while trabeculae in larger animals femora are thicker further apart and fewer per unit volume than in smaller animals finite element modelling indicates that trabecular scaling does not alter the bulk stiffness of trabecular bone but does alter strain within trabeculae under equal applied loads allometry of bone s trabecular tissue may contribute to the skeleton s ability to withstand load without incurring the physiological or mechanical costs of increasing bone mass
effect of catch bonding on transport of cellular cargo by dynein motors ||||| recent experiments have demonstrated that dynein motors exhibit catch bonding behavior in which the unbinding rate of a single dynein decreases with increasing force for a certain range of force motivated by these experiments we study the effect of catch bonding on unidirectional transport properties of cellular cargo carried by multiple dynein motors we introduce a threshold force bond deformation tfbd model consistent with the experiments wherein catch bonding sets in beyond a critical applied load force we find catch bonding can result in dramatic changes in the transport properties which are in sharp contrast to kinesin driven unidirectional transport where catch bonding is absent we predict that under certain conditions the average velocity of the cellular cargo can actually increase as applied load is increased we characterize the transport properties in terms of a velocity profile plot in the parameter space of the catch bond strength and the stall force of the motor this plot yields predictions that may be experimentally accessed by suitable modifications of motor transport and binding properties
the advantages of a tapered whisker ||||| the role of facial vibrissae whiskers in the behavior of terrestrial mammals is principally as a supplement or substitute for short distance vision each whisker in the array functions as a mechanical transducer conveying forces applied along the shaft to mechanoreceptors in the follicle at the whisker base subsequent processing of mechanoreceptor output in the trigeminal nucleus and somatosensory cortex allows high accuracy discriminations of object distance direction and surface texture the whiskers of terrestrial mammals are tapered and approximately circular in cross section we characterize the taper of whiskers in nine mammal species measure the mechanical deflection of isolated felid whiskers and discuss the mechanics of a single whisker under static and oscillatory deflections we argue that a tapered whisker provides some advantages for tactile perception as compared to a hypothetical untapered whisker and that this may explain why the taper has been preserved during the evolution of terrestrial mammals
implications of the mesophyll conductance to co for photosynthesis and water use efficiency during long term water stress and recovery in two contrasting eucalyptus species ||||| water stress ws slows growth and photosynthesis a n but most knowledge comes from short time studies that do not account for longer term acclimation processes that are especially relevant in tree species using two eucalyptus species that contrast in drought tolerance we induced moderate and severe water deficits by withholding water until stomatal conductance g sw decreased to two pre defined values for d ws was maintained at the target g sw for d and then plants were re watered additionally we developed new equations to simulate the effect on mesophyll conductance g m of accounting for the resistance to refixation of co the diffusive limitations to co dominated by the stomata were the most important constraints to a n full recovery of a n was reached after re watering characterized by quick recovery of gm and even higher biochemical capacity in contrast to the slower recovery of g sw the acclimation to long term ws led to decreased mesophyll and biochemical limitations in contrast to studies in which stress was imposed more rapidly finally we provide evidence that higher gm under ws contributes to higher intrinsic water use efficiency iwue and reduces the leaf oxidative stress highlighting the importance of gm as a target for breeding genetic engineering
baobab trees adansonia in madagascar use stored water to flush new leaves but not to support stomatal opening before the rainy season ||||| baobab trees adansonia bombacaceae are widely thought to store water in their stems for use when water availability is low we tested this hypothesis by assessing the role of stored water during the dry season in three baobab species in madagascar in the dry season leaves are present only during and after leaf flush we quantified the relative contributions of stem and soil water during this period through measures of stem water content sap flow and stomatal conductance rates of sap flow at the base of the trunk were near zero indicating that leaf flushing was almost entirely dependent on stem water stem water content declined by up to during this period yet stomatal conductance and branch sap flow rates remained very low stem water reserves were used to support new leaf growth and cuticular transpiration but not to support stomatal opening before the rainy season stomatal opening coincided with the onset of sap flow at the base of the trunk and occurred only after significant rainfall
cell cell communication in gram negative bacteria ||||| over the last decade or so a wealth of research has established that bacteria communicate with one another using small molecules these signals enable the individuals in a population to coordinate their behaviour in the case of pathogens this behaviour may include decisions such as when to attack a host organism or form a biofilm consequently such signalling systems are excellent targets for the development of new antibacterial therapies in this review we assess how gram negative bacteria use small molecules for cell cell communication and discuss the main approaches that have been developed to interfere with it
diel variation in ammonia excretion glutamine levels and hydration status in two species of terrestrial isopods ||||| terrestrial isopods suborder oniscidea excrete most nitrogen diurnally as volatile ammonia and ammonia loaded animals accumulate nonessential amino acids which may constitute the major nocturnal nitrogen pool this study explored the relationship between ammonia excretion glutamine storage mobilization and water balance in two sympatric species ligidium lapetum section diplocheta a hygric species and armadillidium vulgare section crinocheta a xeric species capable of water vapor absorption wva ammonia excretion h tissue glutamine levels and water contents were measured following field collection of animals at dusk and dawn in both species diurnal ammonia excretion exceeded nocturnal excretion four to fivefold while glutamine levels increased four to sevenfold during the night most glutamine was accumulated in the somatic tissues body wall while data support the role of glutamine in nocturnal nitrogen storage potential nitrogen mobilization from glutamine breakdown mmol g in a vulgare exceeds measured ammonia excretion mmol g over fold this may serve to generate the high hemolymph ammonia concentrations mathtype translator ams latex tdl tex ams latex mathtype mtef feaafeart ev aqatcvaufebsjuyzl yd gzlbvynv caerbulwbln hiov dgi btfmbaexatlxbi gbaerbd wdylwzybitldharqqtubsr rnchbgeagqivu je sqqrpepc xbbl f rqqrffpeea xe lq jc vqaqpepm xbba pwe q fs yqaqpepae pg firpepekkfr xfr x fr xb adbaqaaegacigaaiaabeqaamaabaabaagcbagaaiikaiaabg gacaqgubgaaeizaiaabccacaqgobgaaeyaaiaabegacaqgobgaagjb vlaadcfadawgaawcbagaaeotaiaabieadawgaaadbagaag maaqaba aaleqaaogaaiykaaaa a text and high p text nh seen during volatilization the energetic cost of ammonia volatilization is discussed in the light of these findings mean water contents were similar at dusk and dawn in both species indicating that diel cycles of water depletion and replenishment were not occurring
function of the urnulae in protecting the red velvet mite balaustium sp against water loss and in enhancing its activity at high temperatures ||||| abstract features of balaustium sp include resistance to intense heat and desiccation affinity for hot surfaces in bright light abundance in semi arid arid biotopes and a large pair of secretory glands called umulae with no known function defense secretion excepted here we show that the urnulae secrete a waterproofing barrier that reduces the mite s cuticular permeability to water exposure to white light was used to stimulate release of the secretion the urnulae protruded and exuded streams of red fluid at the tip of this structure that covered the entire body results showed that mites coated with urnulae secretion lost water at approximately half the rate of mites that did not secrete similarly urnulae secretion coated mites demonstrated an increase in water tightness of the cuticle reflected by a degc elevation in temperature threshold for water loss on an evaporation curve increasing their optimal temperature tolerance for survival lethal permeability temperature lpt results also show a kj mol drop in activation energy e a for water loss representative of a substantial cuticular modification and a decrease in arrhenius frequency steric factor a indicating an overall decrease in body water losses the absence of a critical transition temperature ctt however reveals that urnulae secretion coating functions to resist a phase change as the temperature rises permitting the mites to cope with high temperature without succumbing to water and heat stress by inhibiting cuticular breakdown
flaw tolerance of nuclear intermediate filament lamina under extreme mechanical deformation ||||| the nuclear lamina composed of intermediate filaments is a structural protein meshwork at the nuclear membrane that protects genetic material and regulates gene expression here we uncover the physical basis of the material design of nuclear lamina that enables it to withstand extreme mechanical deformation of strain despite the presence of structural defects through a simple in silico model we demonstrate that this is due to nanoscale mechanisms including protein unfolding alpha to beta transition and sliding resulting in a characteristic nonlinear force extension curve at the larger microscale this leads to an extreme delocalization of mechanical energy dissipation preventing catastrophic crack propagation yet when catastrophic failure occurs under extreme loading individual protein filaments are sacrificed rather than the entire meshwork this mechanism is theoretically explained by a characteristic change of the tangent stress strain hardening exponent under increasing strain our results elucidate the large extensibility of the nuclear lamina within muscle or skin tissue and potentially many other protein materials that are exposed to extreme mechanical conditions and provide a new paradigm toward the de novo design of protein materials by engineering the nonlinear stress strain response to facilitate flaw tolerant behavior
rethinking the value of high wood density ||||| summary current thinking holds that wood density mediates a tradeoff between strength and economy of construction with higher wood density providing higher strength but at higher cost yet the further away wood fibres are from the central axis of the trunk the more they increase the strength of the trunk thus a fat trunk of low density wood can achieve greater strength at lower construction cost than a thin trunk of high density wood what then are the countervailing advantages of high wood density we hypothesize that high wood density is associated with lower maintenance costs due to lower trunk surface area as surface area correlates with maintenance respiration this advantage would be particularly important to long lived trees and could in part explain why they tend to have high wood density high wood density has also been associated with lower risk of trunk breakage xylem implosion and pathogen invasion but we argue that these relationships are not causal and instead reflect correlated selection on other traits of value to long lived trees this revaluation of the costs and benefits of high wood density has important implications for understanding tree life history evolution functional diversity forest carbon stocks and the impacts of global change
flight of a samara alsomitra macrocarpa ||||| the steady gliding flight of samples of alsomitra macrocarpa samara was filmed and analysed by using the observed data the flight performance of the samara was made clear the lift to drag ratio or the gliding ratio was about and the rate of descent was m sec which was smaller than those of other rotary seeds the flight was so stable that samples were seen to take their optimal trimmed angle of attack with a value between the maximum gliding ratio and the minimum rate of descent the aerodynamic function of the husk for the distribution of the seeds was also revealed by making wind tunnel tests of the husk
there are abundant antimicrobial peptides in brains of two kinds of bombina toads ||||| it is well known that there is a large amount of antimicrobial peptides in amphibian skins but few antimicrobial peptides are found in amphibian brains twenty two and four antimicrobial peptides were purified and characterized from the brain homogenate of bombina maxima and b microdeladigitora respectively one hundred fifty eight cdna clones encoding antimicrobial peptides were isolated from brain cdna libraries of b maxima and b microdeladigitora these antimicrobial peptides belong to two peptide groups maximin and maximin h twenty of them are identical to previously reported antimicrobial peptides maximin maximin h from b maxima skin secretions fifty nine of them are novel antimicrobial peptides some of these antimicrobial peptides showed strong antimicrobial activities against tested microorganism strains including gram positive and negative bacteria and fungi the current diversity in peptide coding cdna sequences is to our knowledge the most extreme yet described for any animal brains the extreme diversity may give rise to interest to prospect the actual functions of antimicrobial peptides in amphibian brains
light harvesting mechanism of bacteria exploits a critical interplay between the dynamics of transport and trapping ||||| light harvesting bacteria rhodospirillum photometricum were recently found to adopt strikingly different architectures depending on illumination conditions we present analytic and numerical calculations which explain this observation by quantifying a dynamical interplay between excitation transfer kinetics and reaction center cycling high light intensity membranes exploit dissipation as a photoprotective mechanism thereby safeguarding a steady supply of chemical energy while low light intensity membranes efficiently process unused illumination intensity by channeling it to open reaction centers more generally our analysis elucidates and quantifies the trade offs in natural network design for solar energy conversion
humidity affects the extensibility of an orb weaving spider s viscous thread droplets ||||| summary the prey capture threads found in most spider orb webs rely on viscous droplets for their stickiness each droplet is formed of a central mass of viscoelastic glycoprotein glue surrounded by an aqueous covering both of which incorporate hydrophilic components we found that the extensibility of droplets on larinioides cornutus threads increased as humidity increased however the deflection of the droplets supporting axial lines did not change indicating that atmospheric water uptake increases glycoprotein plasticity but not glycoprotein adhesion the extensibility of droplets along with that of the thread s supporting axial fibers is responsible for summing the adhesion of multiple thread droplets therefore daily changes in humidity have the potential to significantly alter the performance of viscous threads and orb webs
flagellar oscillation a commentary on proposed mechanisms ||||| eukaryotic flagella and cilia have a remarkably uniform internal engine known as the axoneme with few exceptions the function of cilia and flagella is to beat rhythmically and set up relative motion between themselves and the liquid that surrounds them the molecular basis of axonemal movement is understood in considerable detail with the exception of the mechanism that provides its rhythmical or oscillatory quality some kind of repetitive switching event is assumed to occur there are several proposals regarding the nature of the switch and how it might operate herein i first summarise all the factors known to influence the rate of the oscillation the beating frequency many of these factors exert their effect through modulating the mean sliding velocity between the nine doublet microtubules of the axoneme this velocity being the determinant of bend growth rate and bend propagation rate then i explain six proposed mechanisms for flagellar oscillation and review the evidence on which they are based finally i attempt to derive an economical synthesis drawing for preference on experimental research that has been minimally disruptive of the intricate structure of the axoneme the provisional synthesis is that flagellar oscillation emerges from an effect of passive sliding direction on the dynein arms sliding in one direction facilitates force generating cycles and dynein to dynein synchronisation along a doublet sliding in the other direction is inhibitory the direction of the initial passive sliding normally oscillates because it is controlled hydrodynamically through the alternating direction of the propulsive thrust however in the absence of such regulation there can be a perpetual mechanical self triggering through a reversal of sliding direction due to the recoil of elastic structures that deform as a response to the prior active sliding this provisional synthesis may be a useful basis for further examination of the problem
spatial vision in the purple sea urchin strongylocentrotus purpuratus echinoidea ||||| summary recent evidence that echinoids of the genus echinometra have moderate visual acuity that appears to be mediated by their spines screening off axis light suggests that the urchin strongylocentrotus purpuratus with its higher spine density may have even more acute spatial vision we analyzed the movements of specimens of s purpuratus after they were placed in the center of a featureless tank containing a round black target that had an angular diameter of deg or deg solid angles of sr and sr respectively an average orientation vector for each urchin was determined by testing the animal four times with the target placed successively at bearings of deg deg deg and deg relative to magnetic east the urchins showed no significant unimodal or axial orientation relative to any non target feature of the environment or relative to the changing position of the deg target however the urchins were strongly axially oriented relative to the changing position of the deg target mean axis from to deg confidence interval deg p moore s non parametric hotelling s test with of the urchins tested against that target choosing an average bearing within deg of either the target center or its opposite direction two would be expected by chance in addition the average length of the target normalized bearings for the deg target each the vector sum of the bearings for the four trials were far higher than would be expected by chance p monte carlo simulation showing that each urchin whether it moved towards or away from the target did so with high consistency these results strongly suggest that s purpuratus detected the deg target responding either by approaching it or fleeing it given that the urchins did not appear to respond to the deg target it is likely that the deg target was close to the minimum detectable size for this species interestingly measurements of the spine density of the regions of the test that faced horizontally predicted a similar visual resolution deg for the interambulacrum and deg for the ambulacrum the function of this relatively low but functional acuity on par with that of the chambered nautilus and the horseshoe crab is unclear but given the bimodal response is likely to be related to both shelter seeking and predator avoidance
water transport by sandgrouse ||||| water transport in the feathers of birds is not unique to the sandgrouse but the sandgrouse have developed the technique to a stage far beyond that of any other bird that this should have happened in birds of arid zones is not surprising what is not immediately obvious is how it happened the first documented accounts of water transport in sandgrouse are of captive males carrying water in their belly feathers to their young meade waldo st quintin these observations were disbelieved and discredited by later ornithologists e g hile and etch copar meinertzhagen stegmann meinertzhagen even went so far as to initiate the myth that the male sandgrouse regurgitates water from his crop to the incubating female and that both sexes provide their young with water in this way this has since proven to be patently untrue why it should have been necessary to fabricate a story when the truth was so much more fascinating and worthy of investigation is hard to understand
phenotypic flexibility in cutaneous water loss and lipids of the stratum corneum ||||| summary when vertebrates invaded land during the carboniferous period they were exposed not only to new ecological opportunities but also to a desiccating environment to maintain cellular water homeostasis natural selection modified the integument of pioneering terrestrial animals enabling them to reduce water loss through the skin in desert environments where ambient temperatures ta can reach degc relative humidities are low and drinking water is scarce integumentary modifications that reduce cutaneous water loss cwl could be fundamental to survival previous research has shown that hoopoe larks alaemon alaudipes from the arabian desert reduced cwl when acclimated to degc compared with individuals at degc but skylarks alauda arvensis and woodlarks lullula arborea from the netherlands and dunn s larks eremalauda dunni also from the arabian desert did not here we test the idea that hoopoe larks acclimated to degc would alter the lipid composition of their stratum corneum sc resulting in a decrease in cwl but that skylarks woodlarks and dunn s larks would not specifically we hypothesized that hoopoe larks acclimated to degc would increase the proportions of polar ceramide content and decrease the proportions of free fatty acids in their sc compared with individuals acclimated to degc results showed that hoopoe larks at degc had lower cwl and higher proportions of total ceramides but lower proportions of free fatty acids and sterols in their sc we demonstrate that adjustments in ratios of lipid classes in the sc are associated with changes in cwl in hoopoe larks
pyrolobus fumarii gen and sp nov represents a novel group of archaea extending the upper temperature limit for life to degc ||||| abstract a novel irregular coccoid shaped archaeum was isolated from a hydrothermally heated black smoker wall at the tag site at the mid atlantic ridge depth meters it grew at between degc and degc optimum degc and ph optimum and salt optimum the organism was a facultatively aerobic obligate chemolithoautotroph gaining energy by h oxidation nitrate s o and low concentrations of o up to v v served as electron acceptors yielding nh h s and h o as end products respectively growth was inhibited by acetate pyruvate glucose starch or sulfur the new isolate was able to form colonies on plates at degc and to grow at a pressure of kpa bar exponentially growing cultures survived a one hour autoclaving at degc the gc content was mol the core lipids consisted of glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers and traces of di o phytanyl sn glycerol the cell wall was composed of a surface layer of tetrameric protein complexes arranged on a p lattice center to center distance nm by its s rrna sequence the new isolate belonged to the pyrodictiaceae based on its gc content dna homology s layer composition and metabolism we describe here a new genus which we name pyrolobus the fire lobe the type species is pyrolobus fumarii type strain a dsm
microbiology of the oil fly helaeomyia petrolei ||||| abstract helaeomyia petrolei larvae isolated from the asphalt seeps of rancho la brea in los angeles calif were examined for microbial gut contents standard counts on luria bertani macconkey and blood agar plates indicated ca x heterotrophic bacteria per larva the culturable bacteria represented to of the total population as determined by acridine orange staining the gut itself contained large amounts of the oil had no observable ceca and maintained a slightly acidic ph of to despite the ingestion of large amounts of potentially toxic asphalt by the larvae their guts sustained the growth of to times more bacteria than did free oil all of the bacteria isolated were nonsporeformers and gram negative fourteen isolates were chosen based on representative colony morphologies and were identified by using the enterotube ii and api e systems and fatty acid analysis of the isolates were identified as providencia rettgeriand were likely acinetobacter isolates no evidence was found that the isolates grew on or derived nutrients from the asphalt itself or that they played an essential role in insect development regardless any bacteria found in the oil fly larval gut are likely to exhibit pronounced solvent tolerance and may be a future source of industrially useful solvent tolerant enzymes
glycosylated hydroxytryptophan in a mussel adhesive protein from perna viridis ||||| the dihydroxyphenyl l alanine dopa containing proteins of mussel byssus play a critical role in wet adhesion and have inspired versatile new synthetic strategies for adhesives and coatings apparently however not all mussel adhesive proteins are beholden to dopa chemistry the cdna deduced sequence of pvfp a highly aromatic and redox active byssal coating protein in the green mussel perna viridis suggests that dopa may be replaced by a post translational modification of tryptophan the n terminal tryptophan rich domain of pvfp contains decapeptide repeats with the consensus sequences atpkpw taw k and apppaw taw k a small collagen domain gly x y repeats is also present tandem mass spectrometry of isolated tryptic decapeptides has detected both c hexosylated tryptophan w and c hexosylated hydroxytryptophan w the latter of which is redox active the uv absorbance spectrum of w is consistent with hydroxytryptophan which represents an intriguing new theme for bioinspired opportunistic wet adhesion

aggressive pharmacological treatment for reversing malignant bowel obstruction ||||| early and intensive pharmacological treatment not only may reduce gastrointestinal symptoms but also reverse malignant bowel obstruction fifteen consecutive advanced cancer patients with inoperable bowel obstruction received a combination of drugs including metoclopramide octreotide dexamethasone and an initial bolus of amidotrizoato recovery of intestinal transit was reported within days in fourteen patients who continued this treatment without presenting symptoms of bowel obstruction until death this case series establishes that the combination of propulsive and antisecretive agents can act synergistically to allow a fast recovery of bowel transit without inducing unpleasant colic it suggests that the most important mechanism in these circumstances is functional and can be reversible if an aggressive treatment is initiated early before fecal impaction and edema render bowel obstruction irreversible
nonuniform growth and surface friction determine bacterial biofilm morphology on soft substrates ||||| significance shape transformations during an organism s development often arise from mechanical instabilities driven by nonuniform growth a remarkable example is the formation of d wrinkles in bacterial biofilms growing on soft substrates which may enhance the availability of nutrients and signaling molecules to investigate the formation of biofilm wrinkle patterns we developed a chemomechanical model that incorporates nutrient limited inhomogeneous growth surface friction and the ensuing mechanical stresses and deformations we predict the spatiotemporal stress field in a growing biofilm and how it dictates the formation of d biofilm morphology our model provides insight into the observed stages of expansion of vibrio cholerae biofilms and suggests that universal mechanical principles may underlie the formation of d morphologies in biofilms across species during development organisms acquire three dimensional d shapes with important physiological consequences while basic mechanisms underlying morphogenesis are known in eukaryotes it is often difficult to manipulate them in vivo to circumvent this issue here we present a study of developing vibrio cholerae biofilms grown on agar substrates in which the spatiotemporal morphological patterns were altered by varying the agar concentration expanding biofilms are initially flat but later undergo a mechanical instability and become wrinkled to gain mechanistic insights into this dynamic pattern formation process we developed a model that considers diffusion of nutrients and their uptake by bacteria bacterial growth biofilm matrix production mechanical deformation of both the biofilm and the substrate and the friction between them our model shows quantitative agreement with experimental measurements of biofilm expansion dynamics and it accurately predicts two distinct spatiotemporal patterns observed in the experiments the wrinkles initially appear either in the peripheral region and propagate inward soft substrate low friction or in the central region and propagate outward stiff substrate high friction our results which establish that nonuniform growth and friction are fundamental determinants of stress anisotropy and hence biofilm morphology are broadly applicable to bacterial biofilms with similar morphologies and also provide insight into how other bacterial biofilms form distinct wrinkle patterns we discuss the implications of forming undulated biofilm morphologies which may enhance the availability of nutrients and signaling molecules and serve as a bet hedging strategy
the role of kinship in helping decisions among white fronted bee eaters ||||| summarywhite fronted bee eaters merops bullockoides are cooperative breeders in which half of all nesting attempts are assisted by non breeding adults in addition to the breeding pair these helpers assist in all aspects of nesting and their aid significantly increases fledging success the social unit in these bee eaters is an extended family clan in which multiple pairs may breed simultaneously plural breeding as a result helpers often have to choose how to allocate their aid among several potential recipients to whom they are unequally related using five years of data from a color marked and genealogically known population of white fronted bee eaters in kenya we examined the role of kinship in three helping decisions whether or not to become a helper whom to help and how much help to provide kinship between potential donor and recipient was a significant predictor of the likelihood of helping fully of the individuals that could have become helpers did not do so many of these non helpers were unrelated mates in laws that had paired into their partner s clan and had no genetic link to the available recipients others were natal clan members with only distant genealogical ties to the breeders the conditional probability of helping see text for definition decreased significantly with decreasing rh coefficient of relatedness between the potential helper and nestling recipients the presumed cost of helping was a second significant predictor of whether or not a bird became a helper we considered the expending of effort in providing aid and the delaying of personal reproduction to be costs of helping potential helpers that had engaged in high effort activities in the few weeks prior to the helping opportunity showed a decreased likelihood of becoming helpers similarly paired birds which by virtue of having a mating partner had a greater potential of breeding were less likely to become helpers than were single individuals bee eater helpers preferentially chose to aid their closest genetic relatives the average relatedness between helpers and the nestlings receiving their aid was this degree of kinship was significantly greater than that expected if helpers had selected recipient nests randomly from among those available within their clans further evidence of kin discrimination came from analysis of instances in which a helper had two or more nests of differing relatedness simultaneously available as potential recipients in cases the helper aided the most closely related one the magnitude of the helping contribution as measured by provisioning rate showed no pattern with relatedness between donor and recipient these data allow testing of various theoretical models for the allocation of aid among kin since bee eaters helped at only one nest at a time and selected the nest with the most closely related young available their behavior conforms to an allor none case of a diminishing returns model and is inconsistent with alternative models based upon the distribution of aid in proportion to relatedness we conclude that kinship is a major determinant in the decisions both of whether to become a helper and of whom to help in white fronted bee eaters
carotenoid fluorescence in dunaliella salina ||||| dunaliella salina is a halotolerant green alga that is well known for its carotenoid producing capacity the produced carotenoids are mainly stored in lipid globules for various research purposes such as production and extraction kinetics we would like to determine and or localise the carotenoid globules in vivo in this study we show that the carotenoid rich globules emit clear green fluorescence which can be used in for example fluorescence microscopy e g clsm to obtain pictures of the cells and their carotenoid content
stimulation of dna repair as an evolutionary drive for bacterial luminescence ||||| it was demonstrated recently that luminescence of a free living marine bacterium vibrio harveyi stimulates dna repair most probably by activation of the photoreactivation process here we ask whether the stimulation of dna repair could be an evolutionary drive that ensured maintenance and development of early bacterial luminescent systems to test this hypothesis we cultivated v harveyi lux bacteria and luxa mutants in mixed cultures initial cultures were mixed to obtain a culture consisting of roughly lux cells and luxa mutants then bacteria were cultivated for several days and ratio of luminescent to dark bacteria was measured under these conditions luxa mutants became highly predominant within a few days of cultivation this indicates that without a selective pressure the luminescence is a disadvantage for bacteria perhaps due to consumption of significant portion of cell energy however when the same experiments were repeated but cultures were irradiated with low uv doses luminescent bacteria started to predominate shortly after the irradiation therefore we conclude that stimulation of photoreactivation may be an evolutionary drive for bacterial bioluminescence

a comparative study of age related hearing loss in wild type and insulin like growth factor i deficient mice ||||| insulin like growth factor i igf i belongs to the family of insulin related peptides that fulfils a key role during the late development of the nervous system human igf mutations cause profound deafness poor growth and mental retardation accordingly igf null mice are dwarfs that have low survival rates cochlear alterations and severe sensorineural deafness presbycusis age related hearing loss is a common disorder associated with aging that causes social and cognitive problems aging is also associated with a decrease in circulating igf i levels and this reduction has been related to cognitive and brain alterations although there is no information as yet regarding the relationship between presbycusis and igf i biodisponibility here we present a longitudinal study of wild type igf and null igf mice from to months of age comparing the temporal progression of several parameters hearing brain morphology cochlear cytoarchitecture insulin related factors and igf gene expression and igf i serum levels complementary invasive and non invasive techniques were used including auditory brainstem evoked response abr recordings and in vivo mri brain imaging igf null mice presented profound deafness at all the ages studied without any obvious worsening of hearing parameters with aging igf wild type mice suffered significant age related hearing loss their auditory thresholds and peak i latencies augmenting as they aged in parallel with a decrease in the circulating levels of igf i accordingly there was an age related spiral ganglion degeneration in wild type mice that was not evident in the igf null mice however the igf null mice in turn developed a prematurely aged stria vascularis reminiscent of the diabetic strial phenotype our data indicate that igf i is required for the correct development and maintenance of hearing supporting the idea that igf i based therapies could contribute to prevent or ameliorate age related hearing loss
desert snails problems of heat water and food ||||| animal material sphincterochila boissieri charpentier is a fairly small snail average weight about g with a chalky white shell animals used for laboratory studies were collected in the central negev near avdat and sde bokher and shipped by air to duke university summer field studies were carried out in the same area where the mean annual rainfall is less than mm the rains are concentrated in the winter months from november to march and during this period the snails are active feed and reproduce during the remainder of the year the snails presumably remain dormant three types of mineral surface material are common in this area a a firmly packed powdery soil or loess b limestone rocks and pebbles with a granular disintegrating surface and c broken up black flint while sphincterochila is common in the loesslimestone areas it is much less common on the flint substratum sphincterochila is a mud eater that is after rain it comes out and eats large quantities of the surface material loess and in our experience also material from the surface of limestone rocks and pebbles the digestible material contained in this predominantly mineral diet is primarily algae and lichens sphincterochila shows no obvious interest in those higher plants which are eaten by other snails in the same area such as eremina and helicella more detailed information about the ecology of these desert snails has recently become available yom tov
the anatomy and histology of caudal autotomy and regeneration in lizards ||||| caudal autotomy the ability to self detach the tail is a dramatic adaptation common to many structural grade lizards for most species tail loss is followed by the equally dramatic phenomenon of tail regeneration here we review the anatomy and histology of caudal autotomy and regeneration in lizards drawing heavily from research published over the past decades the autotomous tail is characterized by various structural adaptations which act to minimize blood loss and trauma to adjacent tissues the early phase of wound healing involves a leukocytic response but limited inflammation reepithelialization via a specialized wound epithelium is not only critical for scar free healing but also necessary for subsequent tissue patterning and regenerative outgrowth regeneration begins with the formation of the blastema a mass of proliferating mesenchymal like cells as the blastema expands it is invaded by blood vessels and the spinal cord whereas the replacement tail outwardly resembles the original appendage it differs in several notable respects including the tissue composition and organization of the skeleton muscular system and spinal cord increasingly the lizard tail is being recognized among biomedical scientists as an important model for the study of wound healing and multitissue restoration
effect of angle on flow induced vibrations of pinniped vibrissae ||||| two types of vibrissal surface structures undulated and smooth exist among pinnipeds most phocidae have vibrissae with undulated surfaces while otariidae odobenidae and a few phocid species possess vibrissae with smooth surfaces variations in cross sectional profile and orientation of the vibrissae also exist between pinniped species these factors may influence the way that the vibrissae behave when exposed to water flow this study investigated the effect that vibrissal surface structure and orientation have on flow induced vibrations of pinniped vibrissae laser vibrometry was used to record vibrations along the whisker shaft from the undulated vibrissae of harbor seals phoca vitulina and northern elephant seals mirounga angustirostris and the smooth vibrissae of california sea lions zalophus californianus vibrations along the whisker shaft were measured in a flume tank at three orientations deg deg deg to the water flow the results show that vibration frequency and velocity ranges were similar for both undulated and smooth vibrissae angle of orientation rather than surface structure had the greatest effect on flow induced vibrations vibration velocity was up to times higher when the wide flat aspect of the whisker faced into the flow deg compared to when the thin edge faced into the flow deg vibration frequency was also dependent on angle of orientation peak frequencies were measured up to hz and were highest at the deg orientation for all whiskers furthermore ct scanning was used to quantify the three dimensional structure of pinniped vibrissae that may influence flow interactions the ct data provide evidence that all vibrissae are flattened in cross section to some extent and that differences exist in the orientation of this profile with respect to the major curvature of the hair shaft these data support the hypothesis that a compressed cross sectional profile may play a key role in reducing self noise of the vibrissae
an exceptionally fast actomyosin reaction powers insect flight muscle ||||| insects as a group have been remarkably successful in adapting to a great range of physical and biological environments in large part because of their ability to fly the evolution of flight in small insects was accompanied by striking adaptations of the thoracic musculature that enabled very high wing beat frequencies at the cellular and protein filament level a stretch activation mechanism evolved that allowed high oscillatory work to be achieved at very high frequencies as contraction and nerve stimulus became asynchronous at the molecular level critical adaptations occurred within the motor protein myosin ii because its elementary interactions with actin set the speed of sarcomere contraction here we show that the key myosin enzymatic adaptations required for powering the very fast flight muscles in the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster include the highest measured detachment rate of myosin from actin forward rate constant s an exceptionally weak affinity of mgatp for myosin association constant mm and a unique rate limiting step in the cross bridge cycle at the point of inorganic phosphate release the latter adaptations are constraints imposed by the overriding requirement for exceptionally fast release of the hydrolytic product mgadp otherwise as in drosophila embryonic muscle and other slow muscle types a step associated with mgadp release limits muscle contraction speed by delaying the detachment of myosin from actin
respiration by buried echidnas tachyglossus aculeatus ||||| summary short beaked echidnas have an impressive ability to submerge completely into soil or sand and remain there cryptic for long periods this poses questions about how they manage their respiration cut off from a free flow of gases we measured the gradient in oxygen partial pressure po away from the snouts of buried echidnas and oxygen consumption vo in five individuals under similar conditions in two substrates with different air filled porosities fa a theoretical diffusion model indicated that diffusion alone was insufficient to account for the flux of oxygen required to meet measured rates of vo however it was noticed that echidnas often showed periodic movements of the anterior part of the body as if such movements were a deliberate effort to flush the tidal air space surrounding their nostrils these flushing movements were subsequently found to temporarily increase the levels of interstitial oxygen in the soil around the head region flushing movements were more frequent while vo was higher during the burrowing process and also in substrate with lower fa we conclude that oxygen supply to buried echidnas is maintained by diffusion through the soil augmented by periodic flushing movements which ventilate the tidal airspace that surrounds the nostrils
infrared receptors in pyrophilous fire loving insects as model for new un cooled infrared sensors ||||| beetles of the genus melanophila and certain flat bugs of the genus aradus actually approach forest fires for the detection of fires and of hot surfaces the pyrophilous species of both genera have developed infrared ir receptors which have developed from common hair mechanoreceptors thus this type of insect ir receptor has been termed photomechanic and shows the following two special features i the formation of a complex cuticular sphere consisting of an outer exocuticular shell as well as of a cavernous microfluidic core and ii the enclosure of the dendritic tip of the mechanosensitive neuron inside the core in a liquid filled chamber most probably a photomechanic ir sensillum acts as a microfluidic converter of infrared radiation which leads to an increase in internal pressure inside the sphere which is measured by a mechanosensitive neuron a simple model for this biological ir sensor is a modified golay sensor in which the gas has been replaced by a liquid here the absorbed ir radiation results in a pressure increase of the liquid and the deflection of a thin membrane for the evaluation of this model analytical formulas are presented which permits the calculation of the pressure increase in the cavity the deformation of the membrane and the time constant of an artificial leak to compensate ambient temperature changes some organic liquids with high thermal expansion coefficients may improve the deflection of the membrane compared to water
birch betula spp leaves adsorb and re release volatiles specific to neighbouring plants a mechanism for associational herbivore resistance ||||| plant emitted semi volatile compounds have low vaporization rates at degrees c and may therefore persist on surfaces such as plant foliage the passive adsorption of arthropod repellent semi volatiles to neighbouring foliage could convey associational resistance whereby a plant s neighbours reduce damage caused by herbivores we found that birch betula spp leaves adsorb and re release the specific arthropod repelling c semi volatiles ledene ledol and palustrol produced by rhododendron tomentosum when grown in mixed association in a field setup in a natural habitat a higher concentration of ledene was released from birches neighbouring r tomentosum than from birches situated m from r tomentosum emission of alpha humulene a sesquiterpene synthesized by both betula pendula and r tomentosum was also increased in r tomentosum neighbouring b pendula in assessments for associational resistance we found that the polyphagous green leaf weevils polydrusus flavipes and autumnal moth epirrita autumnata larvae both preferred b pendula to r tomentosum p flavipes also preferred birch leaves not exposed to r tomentosum to leaves from mixed associations in the field a reduction in euceraphis betulae aphid density occurred in mixed associations our results suggest that plant tree species may be protected by semi volatile compounds emitted by a more herbivore resistant heterospecific neighbour
structure mechanism and mechanical properties of pupal attachment in greta oto lepidoptera nymphalidae ithomiinae ||||| the structure and mechanism of pupal attachment are described for the nymphalid greta oto using electron microscopy and high speed and time lapse photography the cremaster is composed of a d array of hooked setae that engage with silk fibers spun into layers in a pad on the lower leaf surface each seta comprises a shaft terminating in a strongly curved hook tipped with two lateral barbs these hook into the silk pad which is densely laid and built up in the central portion flattening out peripherally time lapse photography showed that silk pad construction by fifth instar larvae is completed in four distinct spinning movements producing a random fiber arrangement it is proposed that such a fiber arrangement provides isotropic strength giving greater flexibility to the attachment the cremaster is attached to the silk pad by a series of lateral movements of the pupa s posterior abdomen this movement together with the shape of the setal hooks is thought to be integral to the attachment process tensile loading tests showed that attachment failure is due to the breakage of the silk pad which undergoes gradual destruction before releasing the cremaster the attachment was found to have high tensile strength and fracture toughness both of which suggest that it has evolved for the dual purpose of preventing the pupa being pulled from the leaf by a predator and preventing the attachment being weakened by wind which causes the pupa to swing
the implications of niche construction and ecosystem engineering for conservation biology ||||| abstract although strategies to conserve biodiversity e g the establishment of reserves and the management of flagship umbrella indicator and keystone species are valuable they entail practical and conceptual difficulties a focus on niche construction and ecosystem engineering however could provide new insights and methods for conservation biology many organisms modulate the availability of resources to other species by causing state changes in biotic or abiotic materials ecosystem engineering in the process frequently changing the selection to which the ecosystem engineers and other organisms are exposed niche construction we describe growing evidence that organisms have significant nontrophic impacts on ecosystem structure function and biodiversity and outline established means of identifying key species involved in niche construction on the basis of this engineering perspective we propose a number of measures that could be employed to enhance conservation efforts
microbial degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons in a polluted tropical stream ||||| summarycrude oil degradation was observed in water samples from three sites along the course of a polluted stream in lagos nigeria consistent increase and decrease in the total viable counts tvcs of indigenous organisms occurred in the test and control experiments respectively enrichments of the water samples with crude oil resulted in the isolation of nine bacteria belonging to seven genera a mixed culture was developed from the assemblage of the nine species the defined microbial consortium utilized a wide range of pure hcs including cycloalkane and aromatic hcs utilization of crude oil and petroleum cuts i e kerosene and diesel resulted in an increase in tvc till day concomitant with decreases in ph and residual oil concentration crude oil diesel and kerosene were degraded by and respectively in days substrate uptake studies with axenic cultures showed that growth was not sustainable on either cyclohexane or aromatics while degradation of the petroleum fractions fell below in spite of extended incubation period day from the gc analysis of recovered oil while reductions in peaks of n alkane fractions and in biomarkers namely n c pristane and n c phytane ratios were observed in culture fluids of pure strains complete removal of all the hc components of kerosene diesel and crude oil including the isoprenoids was obtained with the consortium within days
biomimetic spider leg joints a review from biomechanical research to compliant robotic actuators ||||| due to their inherent compliance soft actuated joints are becoming increasingly important for robotic applications especially when human robot interactions are expected several of these flexible actuators are inspired by biological models one perfect showpiece for biomimetic robots is the spider leg because it combines lightweight design and graceful movements with powerful and dynamic actuation building on this motivation the review article focuses on compliant robotic joints inspired by the function principle of the spider leg the mechanism is introduced by an overview of existing biological and biomechanical research thereupon a classification of robots that are bio inspired by spider joints is presented based on this the biomimetic robot applications referring to the spider principle are identified and discussed
structural plasticity and catalysis regulation of a thermosensor histidine kinase ||||| temperature sensing is essential for the survival of living cells a major challenge is to understand how a biological thermometer processes thermal information to optimize cellular functions using structural and biochemical approaches we show that the thermosensitive histidine kinase desk from bacillus subtilis is cold activated through specific interhelical rearrangements in its central four helix bundle domain as revealed by the crystal structures of desk in different functional states the plasticity of this helical domain influences the catalytic activities of the protein either by modifying the mobility of the atp binding domains for autokinase activity or by modulating binding of the cognate response regulator to sustain the phosphotransferase and phosphatase activities the structural and biochemical data suggest a model in which the transmembrane sensor domain of desk promotes these structural changes through conformational signals transmitted by the membrane connecting two helical coiled coil ultimately controlling the alternation between output autokinase and phosphatase activities the structural comparison of the different desk variants indicates that incoming signals can take the form of helix rotations and asymmetric helical bends similar to those reported for other sensing systems suggesting that a similar switching mechanism could be operational in a wide range of sensor histidine kinases
desert geophytes under dew and fog the curly whirlies of namaqualand south africa ||||| abstract in the semidesert of namaqualand and adjacent regions of the former cape province south africa there occurs an assemblage of geophytes belonging to eight monocot families and some oxalis species that exhibit special morphological adaptations of their aerial parts to harvest and absorb water from dew and fog the main source of moisture in this region most of them pass their vegetative phase in winter leaves and in some cases axes display a circinate helical tortuose or serpentine shape and or their margins are undulate or crispate or and are provided with a ciliate or fimbriate pilosity of uncommon appearance these morphomes rare elsewhere among monocotyledons promote an increased deposit of dew and fog by enlargement of surfaces and edges keeping at the same time the overall size of the leaves restricted they improve the water budget of these plants in three ways remnant water on the aerial parts retards the transpiration stress at day time although special organs for direct absorption seem to be absent field and laboratory tests show that considerable uptake of water occurs but in quantities not exceeding that capacity found in many non desert plants the water harvest of the leaves dripping to the soil and reaching the root zone where it is stored in tubers bulbs corms and rhizomes appears to be the main contribution experiments using artificial directional fog and metal models imitating the natural profiles demonstrate that a surplus of water in efficiency rates of is collected by the various surface types compared to a standard model with a non sculptured plain frontal surface of the same size the higher rates are sufficient to moisten the underlying soil down to the rhizosphere the circumference of roots and storage organs probably does not exceed the area shadowed by the foliage namaqualand geophytes with such morphologies apparently form a novel desert biotype as mesophytes they represent a distinguished strategy besides that of succulents and other xerophytes
evolution guided discovery of antibiotics that inhibit peptidoglycan remodelling ||||| addressing the ongoing antibiotic crisis requires the discovery of compounds with novel mechanisms of action that are capable of treating drug resistant infections many antibiotics are sourced from specialized metabolites produced by bacteria particularly those of the actinomycetes family although actinomycete extracts have traditionally been screened using activity based platforms this approach has become unfavourable owing to the frequent rediscovery of known compounds genome sequencing of actinomycetes reveals an untapped reservoir of biosynthetic gene clusters but prioritization is required to predict which gene clusters may yield promising new chemical matter here we make use of the phylogeny of biosynthetic genes along with the lack of known resistance determinants to predict divergent members of the glycopeptide family of antibiotics that are likely to possess new biological activities using these predictions we uncovered two members of a new functional class of glycopeptide antibiotics the known glycopeptide antibiotic complestatin and a newly discovered compound we call corbomycin that have a novel mode of action we show that by binding to peptidoglycan complestatin and corbomycin block the action of autolysins essential peptidoglycan hydrolases that are required for remodelling of the cell wall during growth corbomycin and complestatin have low levels of resistance development and are effective in reducing bacterial burden in a mouse model of skin mrsa infection the glycopeptide antibiotic related compounds complestatin and corbomycin function by binding to peptidoglycan and blocking the action of autolysins peptidoglycan hydrolase enzymes that remodel the cell wall during growth
a lichen protected by a super hydrophobic and breathable structure ||||| a species of lichen lecanora conizaeoides is shown to be super hydrophobic it uses a combination of hydrophobic compounds and multi layered roughness to shed water effectively this is combined with gas channels to produce a biological analogue of a waterproof breathable garment the particular lichen grows mostly during wet seasons and is unusually resistant to acid rain hauck m the bryologist honegger r lichenologist the waterproof breathable surface allows this lichen to photosynthesise when other species are covered with a layer of water in addition rainwater runs off the surface of the organism reducing its intake of water from above and probably contributing to its resistance to acid rain
the mechanism of floral heliotropism in the snow buttercup ranunculus adoneus ||||| abstract we designed field experiments using solar trackingranunculus adoneusflowers to determine where photo reception occurred which organs responded and howmovement was achieved flower peduncles bend eastwardin the morning and gradually unbend over the course ofthe day peduncles were found to bend significantly morefrequently in the middle region near the floral bracts cm below the flower than elsewhere on the peduncle because the peduncle tip continued to track the sun evenafter the flower itself was removed our experiments con centrated on shielding or conversely exposing variousportions of peduncles from or to sunlight photo reception occurred primarily in the portion of the stemjust beneath the floral receptacle by following the posi tion of landmarks applied to the stem we found that more growth occurred on the shaded side of bent pedun cles compared to the sunlit side in contrast top shieldedpeduncles did not solar track well and grew only more on the shaded side than on the sunlit side thisgrowth differential corresponded to differences in celllength on the two sides of bent peduncles with signifi cantly longer epidermal cells occurring on the shaded sidethan on the sunlit side key words ranunculus adoneus snow buttercup helio tropism phototropism solar tracking
mechanism of closure of the aortic valve ||||| the human aortic valve consists of three cusps made of relatively inelastic muscle free material about mm thick it opens and shuts about once a second and withstands a pressure difference of mm of mercury when closed it usually functions for yr without failure and works so efficiently that very little blood is regurgitated at each pulse in order to support this large pressure difference the cusps must close simultaneously in all operating conditions and should not touch the wall of the aorta for considerable reversed flow would then be required to close the valve this action suggests a fluid dynamic control mechanism which positions the cusps away from the wall of the aorta so that the slightest reversed flow will close the valve
feeling small exploring the tactile perception limits ||||| the human finger is exquisitely sensitive in perceiving different materials but the question remains as to what length scales are capable of being distinguished in active touch we combine material science with psychophysics to manufacture and haptically explore a series of topographically patterned surfaces of controlled wavelength but identical chemistry strain induced surface wrinkling and subsequent templating produced surfaces with wrinkle wavelengths ranging from nm to mm and amplitudes between nm and mm perceived similarities of these surfaces and two blanks were pairwise scaled by participants and interdistances among all stimuli were determined by individual differences scaling indscal the tactile space thus generated and its two perceptual dimensions were directly linked to surface physical properties the finger friction coefficient and the wrinkle wavelength finally the lowest amplitude of the wrinkles so distinguished was approximately nm demonstrating that human tactile discrimination extends to the nanoscale
butenolides from plant derived smoke natural plant growth regulators with antagonistic actions on seed germination ||||| smoke plays an intriguing role in promoting the germination of seeds of many species following a fire recently a bicyclic compound containing a condensed butenolide moiety methyl h furo c pyran one was reported as a potent germination promoter from plant derived smoke in this study a related butenolide trimethylfuran h one which inhibits germination and significantly reduces the effect of when applied simultaneously was also isolated from plant derived smoke the interaction of these compounds with opposing actions on seed germination may have important ecological implications in a post fire environment and could be useful molecules for understanding the events involved in breaking seed dormancy and promoting seed germination
volumetric imaging of shark tail hydrodynamics reveals a three dimensional dual ring vortex wake structure ||||| understanding how moving organisms generate locomotor forces is fundamental to the analysis of aerodynamic and hydrodynamic flow patterns that are generated during body and appendage oscillation in the past this has been accomplished using two dimensional planar techniques that require reconstruction of three dimensional flow patterns we have applied a new fully three dimensional volumetric imaging technique that allows instantaneous capture of wake flow patterns to a classic problem in functional vertebrate biology the function of the asymmetrical heterocercal tail of swimming sharks to capture the vorticity field within the volume swept by the tail these data were used to test a previous three dimensional reconstruction of the shark vortex wake estimated from two dimensional flow analyses and show that the volumetric approach reveals a different vortex wake not previously reconstructed from two dimensional slices the hydrodynamic wake consists of one set of dual linked vortex rings produced per half tail beat in addition we use a simple passive shark tail model under robotic control to show that the three dimensional wake flows of the robotic tail differ from the active tail motion of a live shark suggesting that active control of kinematics and tail stiffness plays a substantial role in the production of wake vortical patterns
a new perspective on radiation resistance based on deinococcus radiodurans ||||| in classical models of radiation toxicity dna is the molecule that is most affected by ionizing radiation ir however recent data show that the amount of protein damage caused during irradiation of bacteria is better related to survival than to dna damage in this opinion article a new model is presented in which proteins are the most important target in the hierarchy of macromolecules affected by ir a first line of defence against ir in extremely radiation resistant bacteria might be the accumulation of manganese complexes which can prevent the production of iron dependent reactive oxygen species this would allow an irradiated cell to protect sufficient enzymatic activity needed to repair dna and survive
optimal localization by pointing off axis ||||| detection versus localization active sensing systems allow an animal some control over the information acquired from the environment for example echolocating bats are known to control many aspects of their sonar signal design however their sensory data acquisition strategies are still not fully understood yovel et al p found that egyptian fruit bats rousettus aegyptiacus did not aim their sonar beams directly on target in a standard localization task instead the bats pointed the main lobe of their sonar beam off axis bats approaching the target emitted sounds to the left and right of its localization in an alternating manner so that the maximum slope of the change in intensity of the sonar beam was often positioned close to the target this echolocation strategy is ideal for target localization but occurs at the cost of target detection echolocating egyptian fruit bats do not center their sonar clicks on a target thereby maximizing localization of the target is centering a stimulus in the field of view an optimal strategy to localize and track it we demonstrated through experimental and computational studies that the answer is no we trained echolocating egyptian fruit bats to localize a target in complete darkness and we measured the directional aim of their sonar clicks the bats did not center the sonar beam on the target but instead pointed it off axis accurately directing the maximum slope edge of the beam onto the target information theoretic calculations showed that using the maximum slope is optimal for localizing the target at the cost of detection we propose that the tradeoff between detection optimized at stimulus peak and localization optimized at maximum slope is fundamental to spatial localization and tracking accomplished through hearing olfaction and vision
templated biomimetic multifunctional coatings ||||| we report a bioinspired templating technique for fabricating multifunctional optical coatings that mimic both unique functionalities of antireflective moth eyes and superhydrophobic cicada wings subwavelength structured fluoropolymer nipple arrays are created by a soft lithography like process the utilization of fluoropolymers simultaneously enhances the antireflective performance and the hydrophobicity of the replicated films the specular reflectivity matches the optical simulation using a thin film multilayer model the dependence of the size and the crystalline ordering of the replicated nipples on the resulting antireflective properties have also been investigated by experiment and modeling these biomimetic materials may find important technological application in self cleaning antireflection coatings
foxo dependent regulation of innate immune homeostasis ||||| the innate immune system represents an ancient host defence mechanism that protects against invading microorganisms an important class of immune effector molecules to fight pathogen infections are antimicrobial peptides amps that are produced in plants and animals in drosophila the induction of amps in response to infection is regulated through the activation of the evolutionarily conserved toll and immune deficiency imd pathways here we show that amp activation can be achieved independently of these immunoregulatory pathways by the transcription factor foxo a key regulator of stress resistance metabolism and ageing in non infected animals amp genes are activated in response to nuclear foxo activity when induced by starvation using insulin signalling mutants or by applying small molecule inhibitors amp induction is lost in foxo null mutants but enhanced when foxo is overexpressed expression of amp genes in response to foxo activity can also be triggered in animals unable to respond to immune challenges due to defects in both the toll and imd pathways molecular experiments at the drosomycin promoter indicate that foxo directly binds to its regulatory region thereby inducing its transcription in vivo studies in drosophila but also studies in human lung gut kidney and skin cells indicate that a foxo dependent regulation of amps is evolutionarily conserved our results indicate a new mechanism of cross regulation of metabolism and innate immunity by which amp genes can be activated under normal physiological conditions in response to the oscillating energy status of cells and tissues this regulation seems to be independent of the pathogen responsive innate immunity pathways whose activation is often associated with tissue damage and repair the sparse production of amps in epithelial tissues in response to foxo may help modulating the defence reaction without harming the host tissues in particular when animals are suffering from energy shortage or stress
bioinspired synthesis of mesoporous silicas ||||| abstract recent years have witnessed rapid growth in the number of new investigations at the interface of materials chemistry and biology this review highlights the recent developments in the studies of protein mediated silica biomineralization in diatoms and the downscaling and upscaling models derived thereof as well as the recent progress in the fabrication of artificial silicas with novel pore structures and morphologies at different length scales based on these new insights into biosilica formation
ladder polyether synthesis via epoxide opening cascades using a disappearing directing group ||||| the combination of a trimethylsilyl group a bronsted base a fluoride source and a hydroxylic solvent enables the first construction of the tetrad of tetrahydropyran rings found in the majority of the ladder polyether natural products by way of a cascade of epoxide opening events that emulates the final step of nakanishi s proposed biosynthetic pathway the trimethylsilyl group disappears during the course of the cascade and thus these are the first epoxide ring opening cascades that afford ladder polyether subunits containing no directing groups at the end of the cascade
on the strength stiffness and stability of tubular plant stems and leaves ||||| thin walled tubes of circular cross section are efficient structural elements and thus as would be expected are not uncommon in plants especially those which belong to the monocotyledonae traditional analyses of the strength of these tubular members utilize formulae which were developed for isotropic materials the present paper deals with the great influence of the high elastic anisotropy of the plant tissue on the mechanical behavior of such tubular stems and leaves in bending it will be seen that under these circumstances the propensity of the tube to fail due to non linear effects deformation of the cross section is greatly increased
extracellular electron transfer via microbial nanowires ||||| microbes that can transfer electrons to extracellular electron acceptors such as fe iii oxides are important in organic matter degradation and nutrient cycling in soils and sediments previous investigations on electron transfer to fe iii have focused on the role of outer membrane c type cytochromes however some fe iii reducers lack c cytochromes geobacter species which are the predominant fe iii reducers in many environments must directly contact fe iii oxides to reduce them and produce monolateral pili that were proposed on the basis of the role of pili in other organisms to aid in establishing contact with the fe iii oxides here we report that a pilus deficient mutant of geobacter sulfurreducens could not reduce fe iii oxides but could attach to them conducting probe atomic force microscopy revealed that the pili were highly conductive these results indicate that the pili of g sulfurreducens might serve as biological nanowires transferring electrons from the cell surface to the surface of fe iii oxides electron transfer through pili indicates possibilities for other unique cell surface and cell cell interactions and for bioengineering of novel conductive materials
leaves in the lowest and highest winds temperature force and shape ||||| climatic extremes can be as significant as averages in setting the conditions for successful organismal function and in determining the distribution of different forms for lightweight flexible structures such as leaves even extremes lasting a few seconds can matter the present review considers two extreme situations that may pose existential risks broad leaves heat rapidly when ambient air flows drop below c m s devices implicated in minimizing heating include reduction in size lobing and adjustments of orientation to improve convective cooling low near infrared absorptivity and thickening for short term heat storage different features become relevant when storm gusts threaten to tear leaves and uproot trees with leaf level winds of m s or more both individual leaves and clusters may curl into low drag stable cones and cylinders facilitated by particular blade shapes petioles that twist readily and sufficient low speed instability to initiate reconfiguration while such factors may have implications in many areas remarkably little relevant experimental work has addressed them
how pine cones open ||||| the scales of seed bearing pine cones move in response to changes in relative humidity the scales gape open when it is dry releasing the cone s seeds when it is damp the scales close up the cells in a mature cone are dead so the mechanism is passive the structure of the scale and the walls of the cells composing the scale respond to changing relative humidity dissection of cones from the monterey pine pinus radiata revealed to us two types of scale growing from the main body of the cone the ovuliferous scale and the bract scale the larger ovuliferous scales respond to changes in relative humidity when removed from the body of the cone
iron clad fibers a metal based biological strategy for hard flexible coatings ||||| mussel fibers while it is possible to make strong fibers or threads from organic materials most suffer from high wear abrasion marine mussels attach themselves to rocky seashores using a series of byssal threads despite the constant rubbing caused by the motion of the tides the threads show high wear resistance harrington et al p published online march see the perspective by messersmith now find that the threads are protected by a proteinaceous outer cuticle that is rich in the amino acid dihydroxyphenylalanine dopa which is known to be a strong adhesive the cuticle is also rich in metal ions primarily fe the dopa metal crosslinks helped to form the tough outer coating marine mussel byssal threads have an outer coating in which proteins are linked to metal ions the extensible byssal threads of marine mussels are shielded from abrasion in wave swept habitats by an outer cuticle that is largely proteinaceous and approximately fivefold harder than the thread core threads from several species exhibit granular cuticles containing a protein that is rich in the catecholic amino acid dihydroxyphenylalanine dopa as well as inorganic ions notably fe granular cuticles exhibit a remarkable combination of high hardness and high extensibility we explored byssus cuticle chemistry by means of in situ resonance raman spectroscopy and demonstrated that the cuticle is a polymeric scaffold stabilized by catecholato iron chelate complexes having an unusual clustered distribution consistent with byssal cuticle chemistry and mechanics we present a model in which dense cross linking in the granules provides hardness whereas the less cross linked matrix provides extensibility
mechanism of calcite co orientation in the sea urchin tooth ||||| sea urchin teeth are remarkable and complex calcite structures continuously growing at the forming end and self sharpening at the mature grinding tip the calcite caco crystals of tooth components plates fibers and a high mg polycrystalline matrix have highly co oriented crystallographic axes this ability to co orient calcite in a mineralized structure is shared by all echinoderms however the physico chemical mechanism by which calcite crystals become co oriented in echinoderms remains enigmatic here we show differences in calcite c axis orientations in the tooth of the purple sea urchin strongylocentrotus purpuratus using high resolution x ray photoelectron emission spectromicroscopy x peem and microbeam x ray diffraction muxrd all plates share one crystal orientation propagated through pillar bridges while fibers and polycrystalline matrix share another orientation furthermore in the forming end of the tooth we observe that caco is present as amorphous calcium carbonate acc we demonstrate that co orientation of the nanoparticles in the polycrystalline matrix occurs via solid state secondary nucleation propagating out from the previously formed fibers and plates into the amorphous precursor nanoparticles because amorphous precursors were observed in diverse biominerals solid state secondary nucleation is likely to be a general mechanism for the co orientation of biomineral components in organisms from different phyla
the preliminary study on antifouling mechanism of shark skin ||||| biofouling which is the result of marine organisms settling attaching and growing on submerged marine surfaces is a usually seeing phenomenon for the ocean going ships and submarines and it can decrease the range speed and maneuverability of these vessels and increase the fuel consumption contrarily the sharks remain largely free of bioadhesion despite spending their entire lives submerged the sharks have placoid scales which consist of rectangular base embedded in the skin with tiny spines that poke up from the surface it is found that this special structure can make great deal of function for antifouling in our report parallel works for antifouling mechanisms were motivated by triakidae shark feeding observations on shark skin and the experiments of benthic diatoms adhesion and mytilus edulis byssus attachment and the optical configurations were acquired by using d video microscope and environment scanning electron microscope esem the results showed that the benthic diatoms adhesion on the naked skin of living sharks was obviously fewer than the dead ones and could not be found on the surface of placoid scales as the time progressed the rate of mytilus edulis byssus attachment reduced gradually it was thought that the water turbulent boundary on the surface was changed greatly and innumerable minimal vortex was generated when the water flow on the shark skin the strong exchange of momentum in a turbulent boundary layer would produce high speed lumps approaching the surface which could develop strong shear stress benthic diatoms and mussel could not attached firmly or be cleared easily when the shear stress became stronger than the adhesion power of these organisms after finding the real working mechanism of antifouling for sharks it could be used to direct the progresses of synthesizing biomimetic coatings or materials with antifouling performance in the future
long distance transport of gases in plants a perspective on internal aeration and radial oxygen loss from roots ||||| internal transport of gases is crucial for vascular plants inhabiting aquatic wetland or flood prone environments diffusivity of gases in water is approximately times slower than in air thus direct exchange of gases between submerged tissues and the environment is strongly impeded aerenchyma provides a low resistance internal pathway for gas transport between shoot and root extremities by this pathway o is supplied to the roots and rhizosphere while co ethylene and methane move from the soil to the shoots and atmosphere diffusion is the mechanism by which gases move within roots of all plant species but significant pressurized through flow occurs in stems and rhizomes of several emergent and floating leaved wetland plants through flows can raise o concentrations in the rhizomes close to ambient levels in general rates of flow are determined by plant characteristics such as capacity to generate positive pressures in shoot tissues and resistance to flow in the aerenchyma as well as environmental conditions affecting leaf to air gradients in humidity and temperature o diffusion in roots is influenced by anatomical morphological and physiological characteristics and environmental conditions roots of many but not all wetland species contain large volumes of aerenchyma e g root porosity can reach while a barrier impermeable to radial o loss rol often occurs in basal zones these traits act synergistically to enhance the amount of o diffusing to the root apex and enable the development of an aerobic rhizosphere around the root tip which enhances root penetration into anaerobic substrates the barrier to rol in roots of some species is induced by growth in stagnant conditions whereas it is constitutive in others an inducible change in the resistance to o across the hypodermis exodermis is hypothesized to be of adaptive significance to plants inhabiting transiently waterlogged soils knowledge on the anatomical basis of the barrier to rol in various species is scant nevertheless it has been suggested that the barrier may also impede influx of i soil derived gases such as co methane and ethylene ii potentially toxic substances e g reduced metal ions often present in waterlogged soils and iii nutrients and water lateral roots that remain permeable to o may be the main surface for exchange of substances between the roots and rhizosphere in wetland species further work is required to determine whether diversity in structure and function in roots of wetland species can be related to various niche habitats
microtubule assembly dynamics at the nanoscale ||||| background the labile nature of microtubules is critical for establishing cellular morphology and motility yet the molecular basis of assembly remains unclear here we use optical tweezers to track microtubule polymerization against microfabricated barriers permitting unprecedented spatial resolution results we find that microtubules exhibit extensive nanometer scale variability in growth rate and often undergo shortening excursions in some cases exceeding five tubulin layers during periods of overall net growth this result indicates that the guanosine triphosphate gtp cap does not exist as a single layer as previously proposed we also find that length increments over ms time intervals n are small nm mean standard deviation and very rarely exceed nm about two dimer lengths indicating that assembly occurs almost exclusively via single subunit addition rather than via oligomers as was recently suggested finally the assembly rate depends only weakly on load with the average growth rate decreasing only fold as the force increases fold from pn to pn conclusions the data are consistent with a mechanochemical model in which a spatially extended gtp cap allows substantial shortening on the nanoscale while still preventing complete catastrophe in most cases
why do woodpeckers resist head impact injury a biomechanical investigation ||||| head injury is a leading cause of morbidity and death in both industrialized and developing countries it is estimated that brain injuries account for of the burden of fatalities and disabilities and represent the leading cause of death in young adults brain injury may be caused by an impact or a sudden change in the linear and or angular velocity of the head however the woodpecker does not experience any head injury at the high speed of m s with a deceleration of g when it drums a tree trunk it is still not known how woodpeckers protect their brain from impact injury in order to investigate this two synchronous high speed video systems were used to observe the pecking process and the force sensor was used to measure the peck force the mechanical properties and macro micro morphological structure in woodpecker s head were investigated using a mechanical testing system and micro ct scanning finite element fe models of the woodpecker s head were established to study the dynamic intracranial responses the result showed that macro micro morphology of cranial bone and beak can be recognized as a major contributor to non impact injuries this biomechanical analysis makes it possible to visualize events during woodpecker pecking and may inspire new approaches to prevention and treatment of human head injury
the mechanics of the adhesive locomotion of terrestrial gastropods ||||| summary research on the adhesive locomotion of terrestrial gastropods is gaining renewed interest as it provides a source of guidance for the design of soft biomimetic robots that can perform functions currently not achievable by conventional rigid vehicles the locomotion of terrestrial gastropods is driven by a train of periodic muscle contractions pedal waves and relaxations interwaves that propagate from their tails to their heads these ventral waves interact with a thin layer of mucus secreted by the animal that transmits propulsive forces to the ground the exact mechanism by which these propulsive forces are generated is still a matter of controversy specifically the exact role played by the complex rheological and adhesive properties of the mucus is not clear to provide quantitative data that could shed light on this question we use a newly developed technique to measure with high temporal and spatial resolution the propulsive forces that terrestrial gastropods generate while crawling on smooth flat surfaces the traction force measurements demonstrate the importance of the finite yield stress of the mucus in generating thrust and are consistent with the surface of the ventral foot being lifted with the passage of each pedal wave we also show that a forward propulsive force is generated beneath each stationary interwave and that this net forward component is balanced by the resistance caused by the outer rim of the ventral foot which slides at the speed of the center of mass of the animal simultaneously the animal pulls the rim laterally inward analysis of the traction forces reveals that the kinematics of the pedal waves is far more complex than previously thought showing significant spatial variation acceleration deceleration as the waves move from the tail to the head of the animal
photoelectrochemical complexes for solar energy conversion that chemically and autonomously regenerate ||||| naturally occurring photosynthetic systems use elaborate pathways of self repair to limit the impact of photo damage herein we demonstrate a complex that mimics this process consisting of two recombinant proteins phospholipids and a carbon nanotube the components self assemble into a configuration in which an array of lipid bilayers aggregate on the surface of the carbon nanotube creating a platform for the attachment of light converting proteins the system can disassemble upon the addition of a surfactant and reassemble on its removal over an indefinite number of cycles the assembly is thermodynamically meta stable and can only transition reversibly if the rate of surfactant removal exceeds about sec only in the assembled state do the complexes exhibit photoelectrochemical activity we demonstrate a regeneration cycle that uses surfactant to switch between assembled and disassembled states resulting in increased photo conversion efficiency of more than over hours and an indefinite extension of the system s lifetime
convergent evolution of metabolic roles in bacterial co symbionts of insects ||||| a strictly host dependent lifestyle has profound evolutionary consequences for bacterial genomes most prominent is a sometimes dramatic amount of gene loss and genome reduction recently highly reduced genomes from the co resident intracellular symbionts of sharpshooters were shown to exhibit a striking level of metabolic interdependence one symbiont called sulcia muelleri bacteroidetes can produce eight of the essential amino acids despite having a genome of only kb the other baumannia cicadellinicola g proteobacteria can produce the remaining two essential amino acids as well as many vitamins cicadas also contain the symbiont sulcia but lack baumannia and instead contain the co resident symbiont hodgkinia cicadicola a proteobacteria here we report that despite at least million years of divergence the two sulcia genomes have nearly identical gene content and gene order additionally we show that despite being phylogenetically distant and drastically different in genome size and architecture hodgkinia and baumannia have converged on gene sets conferring similar capabilities for essential amino acid biosynthesis in both cases precisely complementary to the pathways conserved in sulcia in contrast they have completely divergent capabilities for vitamin biosynthesis despite having the smallest gene set known in bacteria hodgkinia devotes at least of its proteome to cobalamin vitamin b biosynthesis a significant metabolic burden the presence of these genes can be explained by hodgkinia s retention of the cobalamin dependent version of methionine synthase instead of the cobalamin independent version found in baumannia a situation that necessitates retention of cobalamin biosynthetic capabilities to make the essential amino acid methionine

polarization sensitivity in two species of cuttlefish sepia plangon gray and sepia mestus gray demonstrated with polarized optomotor stimuli ||||| summary the existence of polarization sensitivity ps most likely resulting from the orthogonal arrangement of microvilli in photoreceptors has been proposed in cephalopods for some time although it has rarely been examined behaviourally here we tested the mourning cuttlefish sepia plangon and the reaper cuttlefish sepia mestus for polarization sensitivity using a large field optomotor stimulus containing polarization contrast polaroid filter drums with stripes producing alternating e vectors were rotated around free moving animals polarized optomotor responses were displayed and these responses were similar to those performed in response to a black and white vertically striped drum whereas no responses were displayed to a plain polarizing control drum producing just a vertical e vector this indicates that the animals are able to see the contrast between adjacent stripes in the polarizing drum to our knowledge this is the first demonstration of functional polarization sensitivity in cuttlefish
morphological variations of macrocystis pyrifera in the falkland islands in relation to environment and season ||||| some morphological characteristics of the giant kelp macrocystis pyrifera in the falkland islands were studied from december until march in a shallow and relatively sheltered coastal zone and from december until january in a deeper offshore field exposed to swells seasonal fluctuations in lamina wet weight density and form as well as pneumatocyst wet weight form and stipe density i e wet weight per unit length paralleled fluctuations in frond wet weight morphological differences between canopies of the giant kelp in the coastal zone and the offshore bed were probably mainly due to differences in water movement and depth between the two sites laminae and pneumatocysts of submersed frond sites had different shapes than those of canopy forming portions of fronds at the same sites and their internodes were longer
influence of season of fire on flowering of wet prairie grasses in south florida usa ||||| we measured the effects of prescribed fire during january dormant season and may growing season on flowering of three perennial grasses muhly muhlenbergia capillaris gulfdune paspalum paspalum monostachyum and south florida bluestem schizachyrium rhizomatum which are dominant grasses in wet prairies of south florida usa flowering was promoted by growing season fire but not by dormant season fire flowering was significantly greater for all species following prescribed fire conducted during may compared with areas burned during january of the same calendar year the strong positive effect of growing season fire on flowering of all three species decreased after the first growing season we rejected the hypothesis that season of fire did not influence flowering our results indicated that flowering by these dominant wet prairie grasses is promoted by early growing season fire which corresponds to historical patterns of lightning ignited fire in south florida
evolution of the metathoracic tympanal ear and its mesothoracic homologue in the macrolepidoptera insecta ||||| abstract two independent methods of comparison serial homology and phylogenetic character mapping are employed to investigate the evolutionary origin of the noctuoid moth noctuoidea ear sensory organ first neurobiotin and janus green b staining techniques are used to describe a novel mesothoracic chordotonal organ in the hawkmoth manduca sexta which is shown to be serially homologous to the noctuoid metathoracic tympanal organ this chordotonal organ comprises a proximal scolopidial region with three bipolar sensory cells and a long flexible strand composed of attachment cells that connects peripherally to an unspecialized membrane ventral to the axillary cord of the fore wing homology to the tympanal chordotonal organ in the noctuoidea is proposed from anatomical comparisons of the meso and metathoracic nerve branches and their corresponding peripheral attachment sites second the general structure noting sensory cell numbers gross anatomy and location of peripheral attachment sites of both meso and metathoracic organs is surveyed in species representing seven superfamilies of the lepidoptera the structure of the wing hinge chordotonal organ in both thoracic segments was found to be remarkably conserved in all superfamilies of the macrolepidoptera examined except the noctuoidea where fewer than three cells occur in the metathoracic ear one cell in representatives of the notodontidae and two cells in those of other families examined and at the mesothoracic wing hinge two cells in the notodontidae only by mapping cell numbers onto current phylogenies of the macrolepidoptera we demonstrate that the three celled wing hinge chordotonal organ believed to be a wing proprioceptor represents the plesiomorphic state from which the tympanal organ in the noctuoidea evolved this trend toward simplicity in the noctuoid ear contrasts an apparent trend toward complexity in several other insect hearing organs where atympanate homologues have been studied the advantages to having fewer rather than more cells in the moth ear which functions primarily to detect the echolocation calls of bats is discussed
organic solutes in freezing tolerance ||||| the accumulation of high levels of low molecular weight solutes polyhydric alcohols saccharides provides cryoprotection to freeze tolerant animals by minimizing via colligative effects the percentage of body water converted to extracellular ice and the extent of cell volume reduction many freeze tolerant insects accumulate high levels of polyols during autumn cold hardening whereas freeze tolerant frogs respond to ice formation in peripheral tissues by synthesizing large amounts of glucose in the liver and rapidly distributing the sugar throughout the body seasonal patterns of enzymatic change occur in cold hardy insects activities associated with cryoprotectant synthesis rise in the fall whereas enzymes associated with polyol degradation dominate in the spring enzyme profiles also revealed the route of glycerol degradation via polyol dehydrogenase and the novel enzyme glyceraldehyde kinase proton magnetic resonance imaging of freezing and thawing in whole frogs showed a new adaptive effect of the very high glucose levels in core organs during thawing organs such as liver and heart melted first allowing recovery of their vital functions to begin while the rest of the frog thawed new studies have examined signal transduction in the stimulation of glucose production by wood frog liver revealing the key role of beta adrenergic receptors and camp mediated activation of glycogenolysis for cryoprotectant synthesis the seasonal elevation of plasma membrane glucose transporters was also shown to be key to cryoprotectant distribution during freezing other new work has shown that frog freeze tolerance probably grew out of preexisting mechanisms of amphibian dehydration tolerance and that both freeze tolerant and intolerant frogs show a hyperglycemic response to desiccation at degrees c
fish mucus in situ measurements of polymer drag reduction ||||| the external layer of mucus on fish was investigated as a drag reducing polymer comparing velocity profiles for water flow over rainbow trout salmo gairdneri and wax models of trout with and without hydrodynamically smooth surfaces revealed that the integumental mucous secretion can significantly reduce the rate of momentum transfer through the boundary layer the difference in momentum transfer is expressed as a reduction in friction drag and discussed in view of the overall drag experienced by fish
visible light reflection spectra from cuticle layered materials ||||| the brilliant metallic appearance of two kinds of beetles the chrysina aurigans and the chrysina limbata is displayed visually as well as from normalized reflection measurements of non polarized visible light under normal incidence the c limbata is reflective over the visible spectral wavelength range with a silver like aspect while the golden like c aurigans is reflective for wavelengths larger than nm and with a well defined sequence of minima and maxima depicted in the reflection spectra both specimens show selective reflection of circular polarized light with the effect being significantly weaker for the c limbata a transfer matrix formalism is applied to approach the main features displayed in the measured reflection spectra by assuming a chirped multilayer structure with decreasing thicknesses of successive layers through the cuticle of the beetles
molecular sabotage of plant defense by aphid saliva ||||| aphids which constitute one of the most important groups of agricultural pests ingest nutrients from sieve tubes the photoassimilate transport conduits in plants aphids are able to successfully puncture sieve tubes with their piercing mouthparts stylets and ingest phloem sap without eliciting the sieve tubes normal occlusion response to injury occlusion mechanisms are calcium triggered and may be prevented by chemical constituents in aphid saliva injected into sieve tubes before and during feeding we recorded aphid feeding behavior with the electrical penetration graph epg technique and then experimentally induced sieve tube plugging initiation of sieve tube occlusion caused a change in aphid behavior from phloem sap ingestion to secretion of watery saliva direct proof of unplugging properties of aphid saliva was provided by the effect of aphid saliva on forisomes forisomes are proteinaceous inclusions in sieve tubes of legumes that show calcium regulated changes in conformation between a contracted state below calcium threshold that does not occlude the sieve tubes and a dispersed state above calcium threshold that occludes the sieve tubes we demonstrated in vitro that aphid saliva induces dispersed forisomes to revert back to the nonplugging contracted state labeling western blotted saliva proteins with ca or ruthenium red inferred the presence of calcium binding domains these results demonstrate that aphid saliva has the ability to prevent sieve tube plugging by molecular interactions between salivary proteins and calcium this provides aphids with access to a continuous flow of phloem sap and is a critical adaptation instrumental in the evolutionary success of aphids
synergy of multiple partners including freeloaders increases host fitness in a multispecies mutualism ||||| understanding cooperation is a central challenge in biology because natural selection should favor free loaders that reap benefits without reciprocating for interspecific cooperation mutualism most approaches to this paradox focus on costs and benefits of individual partners and the strategies mutualists use to associate with beneficial partners however natural selection acts on lifetime fitness and most mutualists particularly longer lived species interacting with shorter lived partners e g corals and zooxanthellae tropical trees and mycorrhizae interact with multiple partner species throughout ontogeny determining how multiple partnerships might interactively affect lifetime fitness is a crucial unexplored link in understanding the evolution and maintenance of cooperation the tropical tree acacia drepanolobium associates with four symbiotic ant species whose short term individual effects range from mutualistic to parasitic using a long term dataset we show that tree fitness is enhanced by partnering sequentially with sets of different ant symbionts over the ontogeny of a tree these sets include a sterilization parasite that prevents reproduction and another that reduces tree survivorship trees associating with partner sets that include these parasites enhance lifetime fitness by trading off survivorship and fecundity at different life stages our results demonstrate the importance of evaluating mutualism within a community context and suggest that lifespan inequalities among mutualists may help cooperation persist in the face of exploitation
experimental and theoretical quantification of the development of damage in fatigue tests of bone and antler ||||| this study concerns the development of damage as measured by a reduction in elastic modulus in two kinds of bones differing considerably in their degrees of mineralisation laminar bone from bovine femur and osteonal bone from red deer antler antler bone is much tougher than ordinary bone and its failure properties have been investigated in i monotonic tensile tests and ii creep rupture experiments tensile fatigue is another way of examining how damage develops in bone the development of damage in the present fatigue tests was non linear with the cycle number the degree of non linearity was dependent on the level of stress and followed a clearly different course for bone and antler antler was a more damage tolerant material being able to achieve a reduction in the final modulus of elasticity just prior to failure three times greater than ordinary bone the evolution of damage is quantified by an empirical and a graphical method and by the use of continuum damage mechanics cdm expressions the cdm method shows important conditions found in antler but not in bone that seen necessary for achieving stable fractures and consequently producing very tough materials
nanoscale biomimetics studies of salvinia molesta for micropattern fabrication ||||| the emerging field of biomimetics allows one to take inspiration from nature and mimic it in order to create various products devices and structures there are a large number of objects including bacteria plants land and aquatic animals and seashells with properties of commercial interest the subject of interest for this research is the water fern salvinia molesta because of its ability to trap air air retaining surfaces are of technological interest due to their ability to reduce drag when used for fluid transport ship coatings and other submersible industrial products in which drag is a concern the purpose of this research is to mimic the air trapping ability of s molesta in order to prove that a structure can be created in the lab that can mimic the behavior of the fern as well as demonstrate microfabrication techniques that can be utilized in industry to produce such materials in this work a novel methodology for the fabrication of microstructures that mimic the water pinning and air trapping ability of s molesta is introduced water contact angle water roll angle and adhesive force of the new microstructure and water fern are investigated

shark skin function in locomotion ||||| hydrostatic pressure under the skin of sharks varies with swimming speed stress in the skin varies with the internal pressure and the skin stress controls skin stiffness locomotory muscles attach to the skin which is thus a whole body exotendon whose mechanical advantage in transmitting muscular contraction is greater than that of the endoskeleton
collenchyma a versatile mechanical tissue with dynamic cell walls ||||| background collenchyma has remained in the shadow of commercially exploited mechanical tissues such as wood and fibres and therefore has received little attention since it was first described however collenchyma is highly dynamic especially compared with sclerenchyma it is the main supporting tissue of growing organs with walls thickening during and after elongation in older organs collenchyma may become more rigid due to changes in cell wall composition or may undergo sclerification through lignification of newly deposited cell wall material while much is known about the systematic and organographic distribution of collenchyma there is rather less information regarding the molecular architecture and properties of its cell walls scope and conclusions this review summarizes several aspects that have not previously been extensively discussed including the origin of the term collenchyma and the history of its typology as the cell walls of collenchyma largely determine the dynamic characteristics of this tissue i summarize the current state of knowledge regarding their structure and molecular composition unfortunately to date detailed studies specifically focusing on collenchyma cell walls have not been undertaken however generating a more detailed understanding of the structural and compositional modifications associated with the transition from plastic to elastic collenchyma cell wall properties is likely to provide significant insights into how specific configurations of cell wall polymers result in specific functional properties this approach focusing on architecture and functional properties is likely to provide improved clarity on the controversial definition of collenchyma
evolution of color and vision of butterflies ||||| butterfly eyes consist of three types of ommatidia which are more or less randomly arranged in a spatially regular lattice the corneal nipple array and the tapetum optical structures that many but not all butterflies share with moths suggest that moths are ancestral to butterflies in agreement with molecular phylogeny a basic set of ultraviolet blue and green sensitive receptors encountered among nymphalid butterflies forms the basis for trichromatic vision screening pigments surrounding the light receiving rhabdoms can modify the spectral sensitivity of the photoreceptors so that the sensitivity peak is in the violet yellow red or even deep red specifically in swallowtails papilionidae and whites pieridae thus enhancing color discriminability the photoreceptor sensitivity spectra are presumably tuned to the wing colors of conspecific butterflies
influence of physiological effort of growth and chemical composition on antler bone mechanical properties ||||| antler is a good model to study bone biology both because it is accessible and because it grows and is shed every year previous studies have shown that chemical composition changes as the antler is grown implying constraints in mineral availability and the physiological effort made to grow it this study aimed at examining antler mechanical properties to assess whether they reflect physiological effort and whether they are associated with precise mineral bone composition rather than just ash content which is usually the main factor affecting mechanical properties we examined young s modulus of elasticity e strength and work to maximum load as well as bone mineral composition along the antler shaft then we compared trends between antlers from two populations captive well fed health managed deer n and free ranging deer with lower food quality and no health treatment n greater e strength and work were found for better fed and health managed deer in addition antler chemical composition of both populations differed in na mg k fe and si and marginally in zn but not in ash or ca content significant and clear divergent trends in mechanical properties supporting greater physiological exhaustion in free ranging deer were found for all mechanical variables detailed models showed that in addition to ash content independent factors extracted from principal component analyses on composition affected e and strength but not work to maximum load the results suggest that there is an association between bone chemical composition and mechanical properties independently of ash content
nitrogen retention in wetlands lakes and rivers ||||| as human activities continue to alter the global nitrogen cycle the ability to predict the impact of increased nitrogen loading to freshwater systems is becoming more and more important nitrogen retention is of particular interest because it is through its combined processes denitrification nitrogen sedimentation and uptake by aquatic plants that local and downstream nitrogen concentrations are reduced here we compare the magnitude of nitrogen retention and its components in wetlands lakes and rivers we show that wetlands retain the highest proportion of total nitrogen loading followed by lakes and then rivers the differences in the proportion of n retained among systems is explained almost entirely by differences in water discharge denitrification is the primary mechanism of nitrogen retention followed by nitrogen sedimentation and uptake by aquatic plants
extracellular proteins limit the dispersal of biogenic nanoparticles ||||| high spatial resolution secondary ion microprobe spectrometry synchrotron radiation based fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and polyacrylamide gel analysis demonstrated the intimate association of proteins with spheroidal aggregates of biogenic zinc sulfide nanocrystals an example of extracellular biomineralization experiments involving synthetic zinc sulfide nanoparticles and representative amino acids indicated a driving role for cysteine in rapid nanoparticle aggregation these findings suggest that microbially derived extracellular proteins can limit the dispersal of nanoparticulate metal bearing phases such as the mineral products of bioremediation that may otherwise be transported away from their source by subsurface fluid flow
adaptations to in situ feeding novel nutrient acquisition pathways in an ancient vertebrate ||||| during feeding hagfish may immerse themselves in the body cavities of decaying carcasses encountering high levels of dissolved organic nutrients we hypothesized that this feeding environment might promote nutrient acquisition by the branchial and epidermal epithelia the potential for pacific hagfish eptatretus stoutii to absorb amino acids from the environment across the skin and gill was thus investigated l alanine and glycine were absorbed via specific transport pathways across both gill and skin surfaces the first such documentation of direct organic nutrient acquisition in a vertebrate animal uptake occurred via distinct mechanisms with respect to concentration dependence sodium dependence and effects of putative transport inhibitors across each epithelium significant differences in the absorbed amino acid distribution between the skin of juveniles and adults were noted the ability to absorb dissolved organic matter across the skin and gill may be an adaptation to a scavenging lifestyle allowing hagfish to maximize sporadic opportunities for organic nutrient acquisition from an evolutionary perspective hagfish represent a transitory state between the generalized nutrient absorption pathways of aquatic invertebrates and the more specialized digestive systems of aquatic vertebrates
dermal bone in early tetrapods a palaeophysiological hypothesis of adaptation for terrestrial acidosis ||||| the dermal bone sculpture of early basal tetrapods of the permo carboniferous is unlike the bone surface of any living vertebrate and its function has long been obscure drawing from physiological studies of extant tetrapods where dermal bone or other calcified tissues aid in regulating acid base balance relating to hypercapnia excess blood carbon dioxide and or lactate acidosis we propose a similar function for these sculptured dermal bones in early tetrapods unlike the condition in modern reptiles which experience hypercapnia when submerged in water these animals would have experienced hypercapnia on land owing to likely inefficient means of eliminating carbon dioxide the different patterns of dermal bone sculpture in these tetrapods largely correlates with levels of terrestriality sculpture is reduced or lost in stem amniotes that likely had the more efficient lung ventilation mode of costal aspiration and in small sized stem amphibians that would have been able to use the skin for gas exchange
scaling and mechanics of carnivoran footpads reveal the principles of footpad design ||||| in most mammals footpads are what first strike ground with each stride their mechanical properties therefore inevitably affect functioning of the legs yet interspecific studies of the scaling of locomotor mechanics have all but neglected the feet and their soft tissues here we determine how contact area and stiffness of footpads in digitigrade carnivorans scale with body mass in order to show how footpads mechanical properties and size covary to maintain their functional integrity as body mass increases across several orders of magnitude we find the following i foot contact area does not keep pace with increasing body mass therefore pressure increases placing footpad tissue of larger animals potentially at greater risk of damage ii but stiffness of the pads also increases so the tissues of larger animals must experience less strain and iii total energy stored in hindpads increases slightly more than that in the forepads allowing additional elastic energy to be returned for greater propulsive efficiency moreover pad stiffness appears to be tuned across the size range to maintain loading regimes in the limbs that are favourable for long bone remodelling thus the structural properties of footpads unlike other biological support structures scale interspecifically through changes in both geometry and material properties rather than geometric proportions alone and do so with consequences for both maintenance and operation of other components of the locomotor system
a branched material based on biomimetic design synthesis and electrochemical properties ||||| based on the biomimetic route the metal material with tree like fractal structure was prepared which showed a rough surface observed by scanning electron microscopy according to the electrochemical experiments the formed material exhibited the strong catalytic capability as an electrode in hydrogen evolution reaction comparing with other conventional structure materials under comparable scales we suggested this promotion of property arose from the contribution of the great surface area and the excellent connectivity offered from the fractal structure c elsevier b v all rights reserved

induced niche shift as an anti predator response for an endoparasitoid ||||| when two developmental stages do not share the same ecological niche the control of the niche shift through a change in developmental timing referred to as heterokairy can provide an adaptive advantage for the individual e g if mortality risk is higher in the first niche for endoparasitic species that develop inside another host species mortality of the host may directly induce mortality risk for the parasite thus endoparasitoid larvae should be selected for response to host predation in this study aphids previously parasitized by the endoparasitoid endaphis fugitiva gagne and muratori diptera cecidomyiidae were experimentally exposed to increased mortality risks both simulated attack and actual predator attacks against aphid hosts induced early emergence of the parasitoid larvae parasitoid emergence from the aphids occurred several minutes before the predator finished feeding on the aphid allowing enough time for the parasitoid larvae to avoid direct predation predator induced emergence produced significantly smaller parasitoid larvae than controls but interestingly no effect on endaphis adult size was found to our knowledge this is the first evidence of induced emergence in an insect parasitoid but we suggest that this mechanism might be at work in many other species where plasticity in development time allows the individual to perform an adaptive niche shift
three dimensional structures of avidin and the avidin biotin complex ||||| the crystal structures of a deglycosylated form of the egg white glycoprotein avidin and of its complex with biotin have been determined to and a respectively the structures reveal the amino acid residues critical for stabilization of the tetrameric assembly and for the exceptionally tight binding of biotin each monomer is an eight stranded antiparallel beta barrel remarkably similar to that of the genetically distinct bacterial analog streptavidin as in streptavidin binding of biotin involves a highly stabilized network of polar and hydrophobic interactions there are however some differences the presence of additional hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups in the binding site of avidin which are missing in streptavidin may account for its higher affinity constant two amino acid substitutions are proposed to be responsible for its susceptibility to denaturation relative to streptavidin unexpectedly a residual n acetylglucosamine moiety was detected in the deglycosylated avidin monomer by difference fourier synthesis
microstructured barbs on the north american porcupine quill enable easy tissue penetration and difficult removal ||||| north american porcupines are well known for their specialized hairs or quills that feature microscopic backward facing deployable barbs that are used in self defense herein we show that the natural quill s geometry enables easy penetration and high tissue adhesion where the barbs specifically contribute to adhesion and unexpectedly dramatically reduce the force required to penetrate tissue reduced penetration force is achieved by topography that appears to create stress concentrations along regions of the quill where the cross sectional diameter grows rapidly facilitating cutting of the tissue barbs located near the first geometrical transition zone exhibit the most substantial impact on minimizing the force required for penetration barbs at the tip of the quill independently exhibit the greatest impact on tissue adhesion force and the cooperation between barbs in the mm and mm regions appears critical to enhance tissue adhesion force the dual functions of barbs were reproduced with replica molded synthetic polyurethane quills these findings should serve as the basis for the development of bio inspired devices such as tissue adhesives or needles trocars and vascular tunnelers where minimizing the penetration force is important to prevent collateral damage
architecture of the wood wide web rhizopogon spp genets link multiple douglas fir cohorts ||||| the role of mycorrhizal networks in forest dynamics is poorly understood because of the elusiveness of their spatial structure we mapped the belowground distribution of the fungi rhizopogon vesiculosus and rhizopogon vinicolor and interior douglas fir trees pseudotsuga menziesii var glauca to determine the architecture of a mycorrhizal network in a multi aged old growth forest rhizopogon spp mycorrhizas were collected within a x m plot trees and fungal genets were identified using multi locus microsatellite dna analysis tree genotypes from mycorrhizas were matched to reference trees aboveground two trees were considered linked if they shared the same fungal genet s the two rhizopogon species each formed genets each colonizing up to trees in the plot rhizopogon vesiculosus genets were larger occurred at greater depths and linked more trees than genets of r vinicolor multiple tree cohorts were linked with young saplings established within the mycorrhizal network of douglas fir veterans a strong positive relationship was found between tree size and connectivity resulting in a scale free network architecture with small world properties this mycorrhizal network architecture suggests an efficient and robust network where large trees play a foundational role in facilitating conspecific regeneration and stabilizing the ecosystem
micromechanics of plant tissues beyond the linear elastic range ||||| abstract we investigated the relation between cell wall structure and the resulting mechanical characteristics of different plant tissues special attention was paid to the mechanical behaviour beyond the linear elastic range the underlying micromechanical processes and the fracture characteristics the previously proposed model of reorientation and slippage of the cellulose microfibrils in the cell wall h ch spatz et al j exp biol was supported and is here refined using measurements of the changes in microfibrillar angle during straining our model explains the widespread phenomenon of stress strain curves with two linear portions of different slope and sheds light on the micromechanical processes involved in viscoelasticity and plastic yield we also analysed the velocity dependence of viscoelasticity under the perspective of the kelvin model resolving the measured viscoelasticity into functions of a velocity dependent and a velocity independent friction the influence of lignin on the above mentioned mechanical properties was examined by chemical lignin extraction from tissues of aristolochia macrophylla lam and by the use of transgenic plants of arabidopsis thaliana l heynh with reduced lignin content additionally the influence of extraction of hemicelluloses on the mechanical properties was investigated as well as a cell wall mutant of arabidopsis with an altered configuration of the cellulose microfibrils
phantom hunter of the fjords camouflage by counterillumination in a shark etmopterus spinax ||||| many midwater animals emit ventral light to hide their silhouette in the water column this phenomenon known as counterillumination typically requires fine control over light emission since it needs a luminescence that closely matches the properties of downwelling light intensity angular distribution and wavelength here we provide evidence that although lacking complex structures of counterilluminating animals the deepwater luminescent shark etmopterus spinax could in norwegian fjords efficiently cloak its silhouette from downwelling ambient light to remain hidden from predator and prey this represents the first experimentally tested function of luminescence in a shark and illustrates how evolution can take different routes to converge on identical complex behavior c elsevier b v all rights reserved
ft protein movement contributes to long distance signaling in floral induction of arabidopsis ||||| in plants seasonal changes in day length are perceived in leaves which initiate long distance signaling that induces flowering at the shoot apex the identity of the long distance signal has yet to be determined in arabidopsis activation of flowering locus t ft transcription in leaf vascular tissue phloem induces flowering we found that ft messenger rna is required only transiently in the leaf in addition ft fusion proteins expressed specifically in phloem cells move to the apex and move long distances between grafted plants finally we provide evidence that ft does not activate an intermediate messenger in leaves we conclude that ft protein acts as a long distance signal that induces arabidopsis flowering
ionizing radiation changes the electronic properties of melanin and enhances the growth of melanized fungi ||||| background melanin pigments are ubiquitous in nature melanized microorganisms are often the dominating species in certain extreme environments such as soils contaminated with radionuclides suggesting that the presence of melanin is beneficial in their life cycle we hypothesized that ionizing radiation could change the electronic properties of melanin and might enhance the growth of melanized microorganisms methodology principal findings ionizing irradiation changed the electron spin resonance esr signal of melanin consistent with changes in electronic structure irradiated melanin manifested a fold increase in its capacity to reduce nadh relative to non irradiated melanin hplc analysis of melanin from fungi grown on different substrates revealed chemical complexity dependence of melanin composition on the growth substrate and possible influence of melanin composition on its interaction with ionizing radiation xtt mtt assays showed increased metabolic activity of melanized c neoformans cells relative to non melanized cells and exposure to ionizing radiation enhanced the electron transfer properties of melanin in melanized cells melanized wangiella dermatitidis and cryptococcus neoformans cells exposed to ionizing radiation approximately times higher than background grew significantly faster as indicated by higher cfus more dry weight biomass and fold greater incorporation of c acetate than non irradiated melanized cells or irradiated albino mutants in addition radiation enhanced the growth of melanized cladosporium sphaerospermum cells under limited nutrients conditions conclusions significance exposure of melanin to ionizing radiation and possibly other forms of electromagnetic radiation changes its electronic properties melanized fungal cells manifested increased growth relative to non melanized cells after exposure to ionizing radiation raising intriguing questions about a potential role for melanin in energy capture and utilization
a mixed community of actinomycetes produce multiple antibiotics for the fungus farming ant acromyrmex octospinosus ||||| backgroundattine ants live in an intensely studied tripartite mutualism with the fungus leucoagaricus gongylophorus which provides food to the ants and with antibiotic producing actinomycete bacteria one hypothesis suggests that bacteria from the genus pseudonocardia are the sole co evolved mutualists of attine ants and are transmitted vertically by the queens a recent study identified a pseudonocardia produced antifungal named dentigerumycin associated with the lower attine apterostigma dentigerum consistent with the idea that co evolved pseudonocardia make novel antibiotics an alternative possibility is that attine ants sample actinomycete bacteria from the soil selecting and maintaining those species that make useful antibiotics consistent with this idea a streptomyces species associated with the higher attine acromyrmex octospinosus was recently shown to produce the well known antifungal candicidin candicidin production is widespread in environmental isolates of streptomyces so this could either be an environmental contaminant or evidence of recruitment of useful actinomycetes from the environment it should be noted that the two possibilities for actinomycete acquisition are not necessarily mutually exclusive resultsin order to test these possibilities we isolated bacteria from a geographically distinct population of a octospinosus and identified a candicidin producing streptomyces species which suggests that they are common mutualists of attine ants most probably recruited from the environment we also identified a pseudonocardia species in the same ant colony that produces an unusual polyene antifungal providing evidence for co evolution of pseudonocardia with a octospinosus conclusionsour results show that a combination of co evolution and environmental sampling results in the diversity of actinomycete symbionts and antibiotics associated with attine ants
assessment of the phytotoxic potential of m tyrosine in laboratory soil bioassays ||||| the significance of soil allelochemical interactions was addressed in this paper through studies conducted with m tyrosine an amino acid analogue and a potent plant growth inhibitor in a series of laboratory assays performed in field soil or growth media the studies were performed as a basis for further evaluation of m tyrosine activity in field soils containing living plant roots here we examined the role of common soil amendments including ammonium nitrate fertilizer and activated carbon in overcoming plant growth inhibition in soils in a laboratory setting by using lettuce as a sensitive indicator of plant toxicity the phytotoxicity of m tyrosine was not influenced significantly by soil n amendment however when significant amounts of activated carbon were added to the soil medium growth inhibition in treated lettuce seedlings was strongly reduced soil texture did not influence the bioavailability or activity of m tyrosine as activity in high organic growth media was similar to that of sand and soil mixtures similar to other purported allelochemicals soil persistence of m tyrosine was limited with a predicted half life of less than day in soil in a controlled laboratory setting rapid degradation of this molecule likely was due to microbial activity but degradation did not appear to be influenced significantly by soil n amendment given the observed activity of m tyrosine in soil and growth media on seedling growth potential may exist for development of m tyrosine as a soil applied herbicide if formulations can be stabilized under soil conditions
serotonin mediates behavioral gregarization underlying swarm formation in desert locusts ||||| desert locusts schistocerca gregaria show extreme phenotypic plasticity transforming between a little seen solitarious phase and the notorious swarming gregarious phase depending on population density an essential tipping point in the process of swarm formation is the initial switch from strong mutual aversion in solitarious locusts to coherent group formation and greater activity in gregarious locusts we show here that serotonin an evolutionarily conserved mediator of neuronal plasticity is responsible for this behavioral transformation being both necessary if behavioral gregarization is to occur and sufficient to induce it our data demonstrate a neurochemical mechanism linking interactions between individuals to large scale changes in population structure and the onset of mass migration
the diversity of hydrostatic skeletons ||||| summary a remarkably diverse group of organisms rely on a hydrostatic skeleton for support movement muscular antagonism and the amplification of the force and displacement of muscle contraction in hydrostatic skeletons force is transmitted not through rigid skeletal elements but instead by internal pressure functioning of these systems depends on the fact that they are essentially constant in volume as they consist of relatively incompressible fluids and tissue contraction of muscle and the resulting decrease in one of the dimensions thus results in an increase in another dimension by actively with muscle or passively with connective tissue controlling the various dimensions a wide array of deformations movements and changes in stiffness can be created an amazing range of animals and animal structures rely on this form of skeletal support including anemones and other polyps the extremely diverse wormlike invertebrates the tube feet of echinoderms mammalian and turtle penises the feet of burrowing bivalves and snails and the legs of spiders in addition there are structures such as the arms and tentacles of cephalopods the tongue of mammals and the trunk of the elephant that also rely on hydrostatic skeletal support but lack the fluid filled cavities that characterize this skeletal type although we normally consider arthropods to rely on a rigid exoskeleton a hydrostatic skeleton provides skeletal support immediately following molting and also during the larval stage for many insects thus the majority of animals on earth rely on hydrostatic skeletons
allometry of alarm calls black capped chickadees encode information about predator size ||||| many animals produce alarm signals when they detect a potential predator but we still know little about the information contained in these signals using presentations of species of live predators we show that acoustic features of the mobbing calls of black capped chickadees poecile atricapilla vary with the size of the predator companion playback experiments revealed that chickadees detect this information and that the intensity of mobbing behavior is related to the size and threat of the potential predator this study demonstrates an unsuspected level of complexity and sophistication in avian alarm calls
