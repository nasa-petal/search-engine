mycosporine glutamicol glucoside a natural uv absorbing secondary metabolite of rock inhabiting microcolonial fungi ||||| microcolonial ascomycetes are known to inhabit bare rock surfaces in cold and hot deserts and thus are habitually exposed to high levels of solar radiation several of these stress tolerant fungal isolates cultivated in the laboratory under daylight illumination were studied for the presence of effective uv radiation protection substances liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms analyses allowed for efficient separation and structure clarification of two mycosporines it was demonstrated that both mycosporine glutamicol glucoside and mycosporine glutaminol glucoside are natural and constitutive secondary metabolites of microcolonial fungi the function and relation of these substances in the fungal cell are discussed
knickkopf protein protects and organizes chitin in the newly synthesized insect exoskeleton ||||| during each molting cycle of insect development synthesis of new cuticle occurs concurrently with the partial degradation of the overlying old exoskeleton protection of the newly synthesized cuticle from molting fluid enzymes has long been attributed to the presence of an impermeable envelope layer that was thought to serve as a physical barrier preventing molting fluid enzymes from accessing the new cuticle and thereby ensuring selective degradation of only the old one in this study using the red flour beetle tribolium castaneum as a model insect species we show that an entirely different and unexpected mechanism accounts for the selective action of chitinases and possibly other molting enzymes the molting fluid enzyme chitinase which degrades the matrix polysaccharide chitin is not excluded from the newly synthesized cuticle as previously assumed instead the new cuticle is protected from chitinase action by the t castaneum knickkopf tcknk protein tcknk colocalizes with chitin in the new cuticle and organizes it into laminae down regulation of tcknk results in chitinase dependent loss of chitin severe molting defects and lethality at all developmental stages the conservation of knickkopf across insect crustacean and nematode taxa suggests that its critical roles in the laminar ordering and protection of exoskeletal chitin may be common to all chitinous invertebrates
erosion resistance of bionic functional surfaces inspired from desert scorpions ||||| in this paper a bionic method is presented to improve the erosion resistance of machine components desert scorpion androctonus australis is a typical animal living in sandy deserts and may face erosive action of blowing sand at a high speed based on the idea of bionics and biologic experimental techniques the mechanisms of the sand erosion resistance of desert scorpion were investigated results showed that the desert scorpions used special microtextures such as bumps and grooves to construct the functional surfaces to achieve the erosion resistance in order to understand the erosion resistance mechanisms of such functional surfaces the combination of computational and experimental research were carried out in this paper the computational fluid dynamics cfd method was applied to predict the erosion performance of the bionic functional surfaces the result demonstrated that the microtextured surfaces exhibited better erosion resistance than the smooth surfaces the further erosion tests indicated that the groove surfaces exhibited better erosion performance at deg injection angle in order to determine the effect of the groove dimensions on the erosion resistance regression analysis of orthogonal multinomials was also performed under a certain erosion condition and the regression equation between the erosion rate and groove distance width and height was established
correlation between the circadian rhythm of resistance to extreme temperatures and changes in fatty acid composition in cotton seedlings ||||| fluctuations in fatty acid composition were examined in cotton gossypium hirsutum l cv deltapine leaves during light dark cycles of h and under continuous light and were correlated to the rhythmic changes in chilling deg c resistance cr and heat deg c resistance hr the chilling resistant and chilling sensitive phases developed in the dark or the light period respectively and this rhythm persisted under continuous light for three cycles the heat resistant phase developed in the light period and an additional peak of hr occurred in the middle of the dark period under continuous light only one peak of hr developed lasting from the middle of the subjective night to the middle of the subjective day the amounts of palmitic and oleic acids were constant during the light dark cycle and under continuous light but those of linoleic and linolenic acids fluctuated attaining a high level in the middle of the dark period or the subjective night and a low level in the middle of the light period or the subjective day a low temperature of deg c induced cr and affected changes in fatty acid composition similar to those that occurred during the daily cr phase a high temperature of deg c induced hr but did not affect changes in fatty acid composition the results in their entirety show that the cr that develops rhythmically as well as the low temperature induced cr coincide with increased levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids no correlation is found between changes in fatty acid composition and the hr that develops rhythmically or the high temperature induced hr
cold blooded snipers thermal independence of ballistic tongue projection in the salamander hydromantes platycephalus ||||| plethodontid salamanders of the genus hydromantes capture prey using the most extreme tongue projection among salamanders and can shoot the tongue a distance of of body length in less than msec the tongue skeleton is projected from the body via an elastic recoil mechanism that decouples muscle contraction from tongue projection amplifying muscle power tenfold we tested the hypothesis that the elastic recoil mechanism also endows tongue projection with low thermal dependence by examining the kinematics and dynamics of tongue projection in hydromantes platycephalus over a range of body temperatures degc we found that h platycephalus maintained tongue projection performance over the tested temperature range and that tongue projection showed thermal independence q values of of all performance parameters including projection distance average velocity and peak instantaneous values of velocity acceleration and power nonelastic muscle powered tongue retraction in contrast responded to temperature changes significantly differently than elastic tongue projection performance parameters of retraction displayed thermal dependence typical of muscle powered movement q values of these results reveal that the elastic recoil mechanism liberates tongue projection from the effects of temperature on muscle contractile rates we suggest that relative thermal independence is a general characteristic of elastic recoil mechanisms and may promote the evolution of these mechanisms in ectothermic animals
the ancient chemistry of avoiding risks of predation and disease ||||| illness death and costs of immunity and injury strongly select for avoidance of predators or contagion ants cockroaches and collembola recognize their dead using unsaturated fatty acids e g oleic or linoleic acid as necromone cues ants bees and termites remove dead from their nests necrophoric behavior whereas semi social species seal off corpses or simply avoid their dead or injured necrophobic behavior alarm and avoidance responses to exudates from injured conspecifics are widespread this involves diverse pheromones complex chemistry and learning we hypothesized that necromones are a phylogenetically ancient class of related signals and predicted that terrestrial isopoda that strongly aggregate and lack known dispersants would avoid body fluids and corpses using fatty acid necromones isopods were repelled by crushed conspecifics blood intact corpses and alcohol extracts of bodies as predicted the repellent fraction contained oleic and linoleic acids and authentic standards repelled several isopod species we further predicted a priori that social caterpillars lacking known dispersants would be repelled by their own body fluids and unsaturated fatty acids both tent caterpillars and fall webworms avoided branches treated with conspecific body fluid oleic and linoleic acids were also strongly avoided by both species necromone signaling appears widespread and likely traces to aquatic ancestors pre dating the divergence of the crustacea and hexapoda at least million years ago
hydrophobins multipurpose proteins ||||| class i and class ii hydrophobins are small secreted fungal proteins that play a role in a broad range of processes in the growth and development of filamentous fungi for instance they are involved in the formation of aerial structures and in the attachment of hyphae to hydrophobic surfaces the mechanisms by which hydrophobins fulfill these functions are based on their property to self assemble at hydrophilic hydrophobic interfaces into a nm thin highly amphipathic film complementation studies have shown that class i hydrophobins belong to a closely related group of morphogenetic proteins but that they have evolved to function at specific interfaces recent evidence indicates that hydrophobins do not only function by self assembly monomeric hydrophobin has been implicated in cell wall assembly but the underlying mechanism is not yet clear in addition hydrophobin monomers could act as toxins and elicitors
chemical niche differentiation among sympatric species of orchid bees ||||| male neotropical orchid bees euglossini collect volatile substances fragrances from flowers and other sources e g decaying wood and store them in specialized hind tibial pockets the accumulated chemicals are later emitted during courtship display presumably to lure conspecific females for mating we analyzed tibial fragrances of males of sympatric panamanian species in the genus euglossa to test whether communities of euglossine bees are chemically structured and to elucidate whether male fragrance signals evolve to convey premating isolation our analysis revealed substantial chemical disparity among all lineages disparity was mediated by compounds that were exclusive to certain species but also by differences in relative quantity of shared compounds we mapped tibial fragrance compounds present in each species on a dna based phylogeny reconstructed using partial sequences of coi ef alpha argk and pol ii and found that most dominant compounds were highly homoplasious in an analysis of chemical differentiation in relation to phylogenetic divergence through time disparity was greater than expected from a null model at any point during evolutionary history suggesting that diversifying selection has shaped fragrance phenotypes notably chemical disparity was greater within recently diverged lineages than among them suggesting that chemical preferences in orchid bees evolved rapidly in the early stages of species divergence we postulate communication interference as the possible mechanism behind the observed fragrance differentiation which may be the product of reproductive character fragrance displacement our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that male fragrance signals evolve to convey premating isolation
alkaliphiles some applications of their products for biotechnology ||||| summary the term alkaliphile is used for microorganisms that grow optimally or very well at ph values above but cannot grow or grow only slowly at the near neutral ph value of alkaliphiles include prokaryotes eukaryotes and archaea many different taxa are represented among the alkaliphiles and some of these have been proposed as new taxa alkaliphiles can be isolated from normal environments such as garden soil although viable counts of alkaliphiles are higher in samples from alkaline environments the cell surface may play a key role in keeping the intracellular ph value in the range between and allowing alkaliphiles to thrive in alkaline environments although adaptation mechanisms have not yet been clarified alkaliphiles have made a great impact in industrial applications biological detergents contain alkaline enzymes such as alkaline cellulases and or alkaline proteases that have been produced from alkaliphiles the current proportion of total world enzyme production destined for the laundry detergent market exceeds another important application is the industrial production of cyclodextrin by alkaline cyclomaltodextrin glucanotransferase this enzyme has reduced the production cost and paved the way for cyclodextrin use in large quantities in foodstuffs chemicals and pharmaceuticals it has also been reported that alkali treated wood pulp could be biologically bleached by xylanases produced by alkaliphiles other applications of various aspects of alkaliphiles are also discussed
seal whiskers detect water movements ||||| how do pinnipeds orientate themselves under water as most pinniped species feed in conditions under which visibility is drastically reduced for example at night at great depths or in murky waters it has been particularly unclear how they succeed in finding food here we show that harbour seals phoca vitulina can use their whiskers to detect minute water movements the high sensitivity of this sensory system should allow a seal to gain hydrodynamic information resulting from movements of other aquatic animals such as prey predators or conspecifics
synaptotagmins why so many ||||| 
the responses of the pupil of gekko gekko to external light stimulus ||||| the responses of the pupil of a nocturnal gecko gekko gekko to external light stimulus were studied the responses of the pupil are determined by light entering the pupil and not by light acting directly on the iris the responses of the pupil are very uniform in sensitivity including spectral sensitivity for light coming in different directions to the eye the possible change in area of the pupil is more than fold and probably represents an effort to shield the pure rod retina from saturating light intensities the pupil continues to contract sharply for changes in external light intensity which give retinal illuminations corresponding to quanta sec striking a retinal rod there is a large degree of spatial summation of the response circular external light fields subtending and deg giving the same illumination at the pupil give approximately the same pupil response the spectral sensitivity curve agrees with the absorption curve of an extracted pigment from a closely related gecko described by crescitelli in the followig paper it is similar to the human scotopic curve but its maximum is displaced about to mu towards the red end of the spectrum the fall in sensitivity towards the red end of the spectrum is described by the equation see pdf for equation
comparative morphology of the tapetum lucidum among selected species ||||| objectives the phenomenon of eye shine is seen in a variety of animal species and is generally thought to be related to the presence of an intraocular reflecting structure the tapetum lucidum the tapetum lucidum is a biologic reflector system that is a common feature in the eyes of vertebrates it normally functions to provide the light sensitive retinal cells with a second opportunity for photon photoreceptor stimulation thereby enhancing visual sensitivity at low light levels the tapetum lucidum is presented here according to a classification based on the location as well as the composition of this reflective layer finally the physical and chemical properties as well as the origins of the different tapeta lucida are discussed and compared methods the anatomic and biochemical aspects of the tapetum lucidum in various vertebrates are examined morphologic observations were made from paraffin and plastic embedded specimens specimens were treated with traditional stains and observed by light and transmission electron microscopy results some species primates squirrels birds red kangaroo and pig do not have this structure and they usually are diurnal animals in vertebrates the tapetum lucidum exhibits diverse structure organization and composition therefore the retinal tapetum teleosts crocodilians marsupials fruit bat the choroidal guanine tapetum elasmobranchs the choroidal tapetum cellulosum carnivores rodents cetacea and the choroidal tapetum fibrosum cow sheep goat horse are described conclusions the tapetum lucidum represents a remarkable example of neural cell and tissue specialization as an adaptation to a dim light environment and despite these differences all tapetal variants act to increase retinal sensitivity by reflecting light back through the photoreceptor layer these variations regarding both its location and structure as well as the choice of reflective material may represent selective visual adaptations associated with their feeding behavior in response to the use of specific wavelengths and amount of reflectance required
a honey bee odorant receptor for the queen substance oxo decenoic acid ||||| by using a functional genomics approach we have identified a honey bee apis mellifera am odorant receptor or for the queen substance oxo decenoic acid oda honey bees live in large eusocial colonies in which a single queen is responsible for reproduction several thousand sterile female worker bees complete a myriad of tasks to maintain the colony and several hundred male drones exist only to mate the queen substance also termed the queen retinue pheromone qrp is an eight component pheromone that maintains the queen s dominance in the colony the main component oda acts as a releaser pheromone by attracting workers to the queen and as a primer pheromone by physiologically inhibiting worker ovary development it also acts as a sex pheromone attracting drones during mating flights however the extent to which social and sexual chemical messages are shared remains unresolved by using a custom chemosensory specific microarray and qpcr we identified four candidate sex pheromone ors amor and from the honey bee genome based on their biased expression in drone antennae we assayed the pheromone responsiveness of these receptors by using xenopus oocytes and electrophysiology amor responded specifically to oda ec nm and not to any of the other seven qrp components other social pheromones or floral odors we did not observe any responses of the other three ors to any of the eight qrp pheromone components suggesting oda is the only qrp component that also acts as a long distance sex pheromone
use of an oligoribonucleotide containing the polypurine tract sequence as a primer by hiv reverse transcriptase ||||| a primary site for initiation of plus strand dna synthesis in human immunodeficiency virus hiv corresponds to a nucleotide long purine rich sequence located just upstream of the u region designated the polypurine tract ppt the hiv reverse transcriptase rt uses its rnase h activity to cut the genomic rna after minus strand dna synthesis a plus strand ppt primer is formed extended and then removed in vitro the hiv rt recognizes this primer specifically using it much more efficiently than other rna primers however the ppt still primes significantly less efficiently than dna primers the nucleotide ppt primer is partially resistant to degradation when compared with other oligoribonucleotides prior to initiation of dna synthesis several nucleotides are removed by the rt from the ends of some of the ppt primers cleavage is enhanced in the absence of dntps we suggest that dna synthesis suppresses primer degradation so that primer extension and cleavage occur in proper sequence as a result of end degradation ppt elongation products contain rna segments from to nucleotides in length these shorter segments are also generated from a longer transcript containing the ppt sequence indicating that they are not created as a result of binding of the rt to the end of the ppt oligoribonucleotide full length and shorter versions of the ppt primers are cleaved from the extended dna by rt these experiments show that hiv rt has a specificity to generate a primer in the region of the ppt but that the ends of the primer are not well defined
notch signaling in osteoblasts ||||| bone remodeling is the result of the coordinated activity of osteoblasts which form new matrix and osteoclasts which resorb bone notch proteins are single pass transmembrane receptors that determine cell fate recent gain of function and loss of function experiments reveal a suppressive effect of notch in osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation in development and in the postnatal bone which establishes a role for notch signaling in bone remodeling
pygmy mole crickets jump from water ||||| summary animals that live or repeatedly alight on the surface of water often need to escape from predators or return to land we show that flightless pygmy mole crickets use a new strategy to jump rapidly from water their powerful hind legs are moved so quickly that they penetrate the surface and as they move through the water unique arrays of spring loaded paddles and spurs fan out to increase surface area this enables these insects to propel a large volume of water downwards in a laminar flow so that they are launched upwards into the air
evidence for a vertebrate catapult elastic energy storage in the plantaris tendon during frog jumping ||||| anuran jumping is one of the most powerful accelerations in vertebrate locomotion several species are hypothesized to use a catapult like mechanism to store and rapidly release elastic energy producing power outputs far beyond the capability of muscle most evidence for this mechanism comes from measurements of whole body power output the decoupling of joint motion and muscle shortening expected in a catapult like mechanism has not been demonstrated we used high speed marker based biplanar x ray cinefluoroscopy to quantify plantaris muscle fascicle strain and ankle joint motion in frogs in order to test for two hallmarks of a catapult mechanism i shortening of fascicles prior to joint movement during tendon stretch and ii rapid joint movement during the jump without rapid muscle shortening during tendon recoil during all jumps muscle fascicles shortened by an average of per cent of total strain prior to joint movement stretching the tendon the subsequent period of initial joint movement and high joint angular acceleration occurred with minimal muscle fascicle length change consistent with the recoil of the elastic tendon these data support the plantaris longus tendon as a site of elastic energy storage during frog jumping and demonstrate that catapult mechanisms may be employed even in sub maximal jumps
the basics and underlying mechanisms of mucoadhesion ||||| mucoadhesion is where two surfaces one of which is a mucous membrane adhere to each other this has been of interest in the pharmaceutical sciences in order to enhance localised drug delivery or to deliver difficult molecules proteins and oligonucleotides into the systemic circulation mucoadhesive materials are hydrophilic macromolecules containing numerous hydrogen bond forming groups the carbomers and chitosans being two well known examples the mechanism by which mucoadhesion takes place has been said to have two stages the contact wetting stage followed by the consolidation stage the establishment of the adhesive interactions the relative importance of each stage will depend on the individual application for example adsorption is a key stage if the dosage form cannot be applied directly to the mucosa of interest while consolidation is important if the formulation is exposed to significant dislodging stresses adhesive joint failure will inevitably occur as a result of overhydration of a dosage form or as a result of epithelia or mucus turnover new mucoadhesive materials with optimal adhesive properties are now being developed and these should enhance the potential applications of this technology
cross linking by protein oxidation in the rapidly setting gel based glues of slugs ||||| summary the terrestrial slug arion subfuscus secretes a glue that is a dilute gel with remarkable adhesive and cohesive strength the function of this glue depends on metals raising the possibility that metal catalyzed oxidation plays a role the extent and time course of protein oxidation was measured by immunoblotting to detect the resulting carbonyl groups several proteins particularly one with a relative molecular mass mr of x were heavily oxidized of the proteins known to distinguish the glue from non adhesive mucus only specific size variants were oxidized the oxidation appears to occur within the first few seconds of secretion although carbonyls were detected by dinitrophenylhydrazine dnph in denatured proteins they were not easily detected in the native state the presence of reversible cross links derived from carbonyls was tested for by treatment with sodium borohydride which would reduce uncross linked carbonyls to alcohols but stabilize imine bonds formed by carbonyls and thus lead to less soluble complexes consistent with imine bond formation sodium borohydride led to a decrease in the amount of soluble protein with a mr of x without changing the carbonyl content per protein in contrast the nucleophile hydroxylamine which would competitively disrupt imine bonds increased protein solubility in the glue finally the primary amine groups on a protein with a mr of x were not accessible to acid anhydrides the results suggest that cross links between aldehydes and primary amines contribute to the cohesive strength of the glue
a vacuolar arsenite transporter necessary for arsenic tolerance in the arsenic hyperaccumulating fern pteris vittata is missing in flowering plants w oa ||||| gametophytes of the fern pteris vittata can accumulate and tolerate more than of their dry weight as arsenic the authors provide evidence that the acr arsenic transporter protein plays an important role in tolerance to high levels of arsenic by transporting arsenic into the vacuole the fern pteris vittata tolerates and hyperaccumulates exceptionally high levels of the toxic metalloid arsenic and this trait appears unique to the pteridaceae once taken up by the root arsenate is reduced to arsenite as it is transported to the lamina of the frond where it is stored in cells as free arsenite here we describe the isolation and characterization of two p vittata genes acr and acr which encode proteins similar to the acr arsenite effluxer of yeast pv acr is able to rescue the arsenic sensitive phenotypes of yeast deficient for acr acr transcripts are upregulated by arsenic in sporophyte roots and gametophytes tissues that directly contact soil whereas acr expression is unaffected by arsenic knocking down the expression of acr but not acr in the gametophyte results in an arsenite sensitive phenotype indicating that acr plays a necessary role in arsenic tolerance in the gametophyte we show that acr localizes to the vacuolar membrane in gametophytes indicating that it likely effluxes arsenite into the vacuole for sequestration whereas single copy acr genes are present in moss lycophytes other ferns and gymnosperms none are present in angiosperms the duplication of acr in p vittata and the loss of acr in angiosperms may explain arsenic tolerance in this unusual group of ferns while precluding the same trait in angiosperms
fog basking behaviour and water collection efficiency in namib desert darkling beetles ||||| backgroundin the namib desert fog represents an alternative water source this is utilised by darkling beetles tenebrionidae that employ different strategies for obtaining the fog water some dig trenches in the sand while others use their own bodies as fog collectors assuming a characteristic fog basking stance two beetle species from the genus onymacris have been observed to fog bask on the ridges of the sand dunes these beetles all have smooth elytra surfaces while another species with elytra covered in bumps is reported to have specialised adaptations facilitating water capture by fog basking to resolve if these other beetles also fog bask and if an elytra covered in bumps is a more efficient fog water collector than a smooth one we examined four namib desert beetles the smooth onymacris unguicularis and o laeviceps and the bumpy stenocara gracilipes and physasterna cribripes here we describe the beetles fog basking behaviour the details of their elytra structures and determine how efficient their dorsal surface areas are at harvesting water from fog resultsthe beetles differ greatly in size the largest p cribripes has a dorsal surface area that is and times larger than o unguicularis o laeviceps and s gracilipes respectively in accordance with earlier reports we found that the second largest o unguicularis is the only one of the four beetles that assumes the head standing fog basking behaviour and that fog is necessary to trigger this behaviour no differences were seen in the absolute amounts of fog water collected on the dorsal surface areas of the different beetles however data corrected according to the sizes of the beetles revealed differences the better fog water harvesters were s gracilipes and o unguicularis while the large p cribripes was the poorest examination of the elytra microstructures showed clear structural differences but the elytra of all beetles were found to be completely hydrophobic conclusionsthe differences in fog water harvesting efficiency by the dorsal surface areas of beetles with very different elytra surface structures were minor we therefore conclude that the fog basking behaviour itself is a more important factor than structural adaptations when o unguicularis collect water from fog
the fastest flights in nature high speed spore discharge mechanisms among fungi ||||| background a variety of spore discharge processes have evolved among the fungi those with the longest ranges are powered by hydrostatic pressure and include squirt guns that are most common in the ascomycota and zygomycota in these fungi fluid filled stalks that support single spores or spore filled sporangia or cells called asci that contain multiple spores are pressurized by osmosis because spores are discharged at such high speeds most of the information on launch processes from previous studies has been inferred from mathematical models and is subject to a number of errors methodology principal findings in this study we have used ultra high speed video cameras running at maximum frame rates of fps to analyze the entire launch process in four species of fungi that grow on the dung of herbivores for the first time we have direct measurements of launch speeds and empirical estimates of acceleration in these fungi launch speeds ranged from to m s and corresponding accelerations of to g propelled spores over distances of up to meters in addition quantitative spectroscopic methods were used to identify the organic and inorganic osmolytes responsible for generating the turgor pressures that drive spore discharge conclusions significance the new video data allowed us to test different models for the effect of viscous drag and identify errors in the previous approaches to modeling spore motion the spectroscopic data show that high speed spore discharge mechanisms in fungi are powered by the same levels of turgor pressure that are characteristic of fungal hyphae and do not require any special mechanisms of osmolyte accumulation
the effect of individual variation on the structure and function of interaction networks in harvester ants ||||| social insects exhibit coordinated behaviour without central control local interactions among individuals determine their behaviour and regulate the activity of the colony harvester ants are recruited for outside work using networks of brief antennal contacts in the nest chamber closest to the nest exit the entrance chamber here we combine empirical observations image analysis and computer simulations to investigate the structure and function of the interaction network in the entrance chamber ant interactions were distributed heterogeneously in the chamber with an interaction hot spot at the entrance leading further into the nest the distribution of the total interactions per ant followed a right skewed distribution indicating the presence of highly connected individuals numbers of ant encounters observed positively correlated with the duration of observation individuals varied in interaction frequency even after accounting for the duration of observation an ant s interaction frequency was explained by its path shape and location within the entrance chamber computer simulations demonstrate that variation among individuals in connectivity accelerates information flow to an extent equivalent to an increase in the total number of interactions individual variation in connectivity arising from variation among ants in location and spatial behaviour creates interaction centres which may expedite information flow
the role of wheat awns in the seed dispersal unit ||||| the dispersal unit of wild wheat bears two pronounced awns that balance the unit as it falls we discovered that the awns are also able to propel the seeds on and into the ground the arrangement of cellulose fibrils causes bending of the awns with changes in humidity silicified hairs that cover the awns allow propulsion of the unit only in the direction of the seeds this suggests that the dead tissue is analogous to a motor fueled by the daily humidity cycle the awns induce the motility required for seed dispersal
ballistic tongue projection in chameleons maintains high performance at low temperature ||||| environmental temperature impacts the physical activity and ecology of ectothermic animals through its effects on muscle contractile physiology sprinting swimming and jumping performance of ectotherms decreases by at least over a degc drop accompanied by a similar decline in muscle power we propose that ballistic movements that are powered by recoil of elastic tissues are less thermally dependent than movements that rely on direct muscular power we found that an elastically powered movement ballistic tongue projection in chameleons maintains high performance over a degc range peak velocity and power decline by only with a degc drop compared to for nonelastic muscle powered tongue retraction these results indicate that the elastic recoil mechanism circumvents the constraints that low temperature imposes on muscle rate properties and thereby reduces the thermal dependence of tongue projection we propose that organisms that use elastic recoil mechanisms for ecologically important movements such as feeding and locomotion may benefit from an expanded thermal niche
the physical state of water in bacterial spores ||||| the bacterial spore the hardiest known life form can survive in a metabolically dormant state for many years and can withstand high temperatures radiation and toxic chemicals the molecular basis of spore dormancy and resistance is not understood but the physical state of water in the different spore compartments is thought to play a key role to characterize this water in situ we recorded the water h and o spin relaxation rates in d o exchanged bacillus subtilis spores over a wide frequency range the data indicate high water mobility throughout the spore comparable with binary protein water systems at similar hydration levels even in the dense core the average water rotational correlation time is only ps spore dormancy therefore cannot be explained by glass like quenching of molecular diffusion but may be linked to dehydration induced conformational changes in key enzymes the data demonstrate that most spore proteins are rotationally immobilized which may contribute to heat resistance by preventing heat denatured proteins from aggregating irreversibly we also find that the water permeability of the inner membrane is at least orders of magnitude lower than for model membranes consistent with the reported high degree of lipid immobilization in this membrane and with its proposed role in spore resistance to chemicals that damage dna the quantitative results reported here on water mobility and transport provide important clues about the mechanism of spore dormancy and resistance with relevance to food preservation disease prevention and astrobiology
new materials for solar thermal storage solid liquid transitions in fatty acid esters ||||| abstract solid liquid transitions were studied by dsc measurements in the following fatty acid esters methyl stearate methyl palmitate cetyl stearate cetyl palmitate and their binary mixtures four systems with phase transition temperature close to room temperature and with high enthalpy of transition and low hysteresis were selected for further studies relevant to passive solar thermal storage the selected systems were methyl palmitate and the eutectic mixtures of methyl stearate methyl palmitate methyl stearte cetyl palmitate and methyl stearate cetyl stearate the samples studied in thermal cycles with programmed heating cooling in the temperature range degc remained stable the studies of the samples having been stored at room temperature were repeated after an interval of months the results showed that the relevant thermophysical properties did not change the commercial building materials gypsum bricks were impregnated homogeneously with the selected molten esters by simple immersion dsc studies showed that up to mass of esters can be adsorbed in the building materials the thermal energy available for storage as latent heat of melting amounts to kj kg of the composite material
a sticky situation solifugids arachnida solifugae use adhesive organs on their pedipalps for prey capture ||||| solifugids arachnida solifugae have unique evertable adhesive organs on the tips of their pedipalps named suctorial or palpal organs previous studies have shown that these organs enable solifugids to climb smooth glass like surfaces and have hypothesized that these structures facilitate prey capture here we use high speed videography to demonstrate that the suctorial organs of eremochelis bilobatus are its primary means of capturing insect prey we also present calculations of the adhesive pressure exerted by these suctorial organs during real prey capture events
the aerodynamics of insect flight ||||| summary the flight of insects has fascinated physicists and biologists for more than a century yet until recently researchers were unable to rigorously quantify the complex wing motions of flapping insects or measure the forces and flows around their wings however recent developments in high speed videography and tools for computational and mechanical modeling have allowed researchers to make rapid progress in advancing our understanding of insect flight these mechanical and computational fluid dynamic models combined with modern flow visualization techniques have revealed that the fluid dynamic phenomena underlying flapping flight are different from those of non flapping d wings on which most previous models were based in particular even at high angles of attack a prominent leading edge vortex remains stably attached on the insect wing and does not shed into an unsteady wake as would be expected from non flapping d wings its presence greatly enhances the forces generated by the wing thus enabling insects to hover or maneuver in addition flight forces are further enhanced by other mechanisms acting during changes in angle of attack especially at stroke reversal the mutual interaction of the two wings at dorsal stroke reversal or wing wake interactions following stroke reversal this progress has enabled the development of simple analytical and empirical models that allow us to calculate the instantaneous forces on flapping insect wings more accurately than was previously possible it also promises to foster new and exciting multi disciplinary collaborations between physicists who seek to explain the phenomenology biologists who seek to understand its relevance to insect physiology and evolution and engineers who are inspired to build micro robotic insects using these principles this review covers the basic physical principles underlying flapping flight in insects results of recent experiments concerning the aerodynamics of insect flight as well as the different approaches used to model these phenomena
are wet induced wrinkled fingers primate rain treads ||||| wet fingers and toes eventually wrinkle and this is commonly attributed by lay opinion to local osmotic reactions however nearly a century ago surgeons observed that no wrinkling occurs if a nerve to the finger has been cut here we provide evidence that rather than being an accidental side effect of wetness wet induced wrinkles have been selected to enhance grip in wet conditions we show that their morphology has the signature properties of drainage networks enabling efficient removal of water from the gripped surface
chemical mediation of bacterial surface colonisation by secondary metabolites from the red alga delisea pulchra ||||| we investigated the effects of halogenated furanones from the red alga delisea pulchra on colonisation of surfaces by marine bacteria bacterial abundance on the surface of d pulchra assessed using scanning electron microscopy sem was significantly lower than on the surfaces of co occurring algal species all of which lack furanones there was also a strong inverse correlation between bacterial abundance and furanone content previously determined for different sections of the thallus of d pulchra consistent with inhibition of bacteria by furanones based on these observations we experimentally investigated inhibition of marine bacteria by furanones initially testing the effects of crude extract of d pulchra about of which is furanones on the growth of strains of bacteria isolated from the surfaces of d pulchra nearby rocks or a co occurring alga sargassum vestjtum this crude extract did not strongly inhibit growth of these bacteria of the strains grew at pg ml of crude extract and grew at pg ml inhibition of growth that did occur was strongly source dependent with bacteria isolated from rocks the least affected and strains from d pulchra the most as inhibition of growth did not provide an adequate explanation for the inverse relationship between levels of furanones and bacteria abundance on d pulchra we proceeded to investigate the effects of these metabolites on other bacterial characteristics relevant to colonisation attachment swarming and swimming lndividual furanones or crude extract at natural concentrations strongly inhibited bacterial attachment in the laboratory and in the field in laboratory assays attachment of strains isolated from rocks was much more strongly affected than that of isolates from d pulchra in contrast to the pattern for growth inhibition we also tested individual furanones against swimming and swarming of the same bacterial isolates from rocks from d pulchra used in the attachment assays at least some furanones inhibited swarming or sulmming at non growth inhibitory concentrations for all isolates again indicating specific effects against bacterial characteristics as for attachment there were significant differences in the responses of different isolates to furanones we also found that the ability to swarm was widespread among these surface associated marine bacteria suggesting that swarming may be ecologically important in these systems overall we found that the effects of furanones on bacteria varied among furanones bacterial phenotypes different isolates and different sources of isolation e g rocks or algae this differential inhibition of different bacterial isolates or phenotypes by furanones as well as affecting overall bacterial abundance on the alga should have strong effects on the species composition of the bacterial community on the alga s surface the effects of furanones on specific bacterial colonisation traits are discussed in the light of recent evidence demonstrating that furanones interfere with bacterial acylated homoserine lactone regulatory systems
regional and global concerns over wetlands and water quality ||||| water quality in many stream catchments and river basins is severely impacted by nutrient enrichment as a result of agriculture water resource managers worldwide are considering the potential role of riparian zones and floodplain wetlands in improving stream water quality as there is evidence at the site scale that such wetlands are efficient at removing nutrients from through flowing water however recent studies have highlighted disadvantages of such use of wetlands including emissions of greenhouse gases and losses of biodiversity that result from prolonged nutrient loading here we discuss the water purification function of wetlands at the site and catchment scale and suggest ways in which these disadvantages could be overcome
effect of blood removal and infusion on gull salt gland secretion ||||| summary the effect of blood removal and addition on salt gland secretion was studied in freshwater and seawater acclimated gulls larus glaucescens in contrast to published reports that blood removal decreased and blood infusion increased salt gland secretion in ducks neither blood removal nor addition had an effect on concentration or volume of salt gland secretion in gulls
enhanced visual fields in hammerhead sharks ||||| summary several factors that influence the evolution of the unusual head morphology of hammerhead sharks family sphyrnidae are proposed but few are empirically tested in this study we tested the enhanced binocular field hypothesis that proposes enhanced frontal binocularity by comparison of the visual fields of three hammerhead species the bonnethead shark sphyrna tiburo the scalloped hammerhead shark sphyrna lewini and the winghead shark eusphyra blochii with that of two carcharhinid species the lemon shark negaprion brevirostris and the blacknose shark carcharhinus acronotus additionally eye rotation and head yaw were quantified to determine if species compensate for large blind areas anterior to the head the winghead shark possessed the largest anterior binocular overlap deg and was nearly four times larger than that of the lemon deg and blacknose deg sharks the binocular overlap in the scalloped hammerhead sharks deg was greater than the bonnethead sharks deg and carcharhinid species however the bonnethead shark did not differ from the carcharhinids these results indicate that binocular overlap has increased with lateral head expansion in hammerhead sharks the hammerhead species did not demonstrate greater eye rotation in the anterior or posterior direction however both the scalloped hammerhead and bonnethead sharks exhibited greater head yaw during swimming deg and deg respectively than the lemon deg and blacknose deg sharks indicating a behavioral compensation for the anterior blind area this study illustrates the larger binocular overlap in hammerhead species relative to their carcharhinid sister taxa and is consistent with the enhanced binocular field hypothesis
a three dimensional study of sub foliar condensation in desert rhubarb rheum palaestinum polygonaceae ||||| the rare perennial plant species rheum palaestinum feinbr polygonaceae commonly known as desert rhubarb is endemic to jordan and southern israel and grows in areas with low annual rainfall al eisawi it has an underground woody stem and grows mostly in shallow ravines of stonysandy terrains during the winter and early spring in years with above normal precipitation it produces one to four rounded leaves cm in diameter with a wrinkled surface fig the large leaf size of this species is atypical within arid ecosystems in the presence of abundant sun small leaf size is considered as one of the most common patterns of desert plants to decrease transpiration rates and increase water use efficiency gibson the annual precipitation in jordan s desert is less than mm and january is the wettest month tarawneh kadioglu a preliminary study of the relationship between precipitation patterns and leaf growth suggested complex and under studied water absorption strategies for plants growing in arid environments our personal observations showed some unique morphologies and timing patterns that perennial plants in the tableland desert of jordan have developed as survival strategies a previous study showed that the large size and surface morphology of rhubarb leaves help to create a self irrigation system and increase rainwater harvesting by fold compared to other desert plants lev yadun et al a simple leaf morphology can effectively drain rainwater without the need for wrinkles that dramatically increase leaf transpiration area as has been shown for the lotus leaf barthlott neinhuis the leaf morphology of rhubarb may not play a crucial role in water collection as rainfall is limited during its maximum growth period march april additionally the leaves are tightly attached to the ground and the margins are bent downward to contact the soil these morphological features favour the function of a vapour trapping system under the leaf rather than water drainage on the upper surface rainwater collection is related to the leaf horizontal catchment area and not to the surface area maximized by the wrinkles because the water absorption rate needs to be higher than the transpiration rate rhubarb leaf wrinkles increase the leaf surface area relative to the leaf footprint and
the geomicrobiology of gold ||||| microorganisms capable of actively solubilizing and precipitating gold appear to play a larger role in the biogeochemical cycling of gold than previously believed recent research suggests that bacteria and archaea are involved in every step of the biogeochemical cycle of gold from the formation of primary mineralization in hydrothermal and deep subsurface systems to its solubilization dispersion and re concentration as secondary gold under surface conditions enzymatically catalysed precipitation of gold has been observed in thermophilic and hyperthermophilic bacteria and archaea for example thermotoga maritime pyrobaculum islandicum and their activity led to the formation of gold and silver bearing sinters in new zealand s hot spring systems sulphate reducing bacteria srb for example desulfovibrio sp may be involved in the formation of gold bearing sulphide minerals in deep subsurface environments over geological timescales this may contribute to the formation of economic deposits iron and sulphur oxidizing bacteria for example acidothiobacillus ferrooxidans a thiooxidans are known to breakdown gold hosting sulphide minerals in zones of primary mineralization and release associated gold in the process these and other bacteria for example actinobacteria produce thiosulphate which is known to oxidize gold and form stable transportable complexes other microbial processes for example excretion of amino acids and cyanide may control gold solubilization in auriferous top and rhizosphere soils a number of bacteria and archaea are capable of actively catalysing the precipitation of toxic gold i iii complexes reductive precipitation of these complexes may improve survival rates of bacterial populations that are capable of detoxifying the immediate cell environment by detecting excreting and reducing gold complexes possibly using p type atpase efflux pumps as well as membrane vesicles for example salmonella enterica cupriavidus ralstonia metallidurans plectonema boryanum gaining metabolic energy by utilizing gold complexing ligands for example thiosulphate by a ferrooxidans or using gold as metal centre in enzymes micrococcus luteus c metallidurans containing biofilms were detected on gold grains from two australian sites indicating that gold bioaccumulation may lead to gold biomineralization by forming secondary bacterioform gold formation of secondary octahedral gold crystals from gold iii chloride solution was promoted by a cyanobacterium p boryanum via an amorphous gold i sulphide intermediate bacterioform gold and secondary gold crystals are common in quartz pebble conglomerates qpc where they are often associated with bituminous organic matter possibly derived from cyanobacteria this may suggest that cyanobacteria have played a role in the formation of the witwatersrand qpc the world s largest gold deposit
emergency networking famine relief in ant colonies ||||| resource distribution is fundamental to social organization but it poses a dilemma how to facilitate the spread of useful resources but restrict harmful substances this dilemma reaches a zenith in famine relief survival depends on distributing food fast but that could increase vulnerability to poisons we tested how temnothorax albipennis ants solve this dilemma in the distribution of honey solution after h of starvation in four colonies with individually marked workers we constructed the complete network of liquid food transmission trophallaxis between individuals within the first min of famine relief of the workers received food and the distribution rate was an order of magnitude faster compared to the controls we tested the assumptions of a simple analytical model that best fitted our data good mixing during famine relief was facilitated by the movement of internal workers away from the brood pile and the movement of foragers with food away from the nest entrance this is intriguing because t albipennis workers have spatial fidelity zones and in the controls internal and external workers were segregated we discovered that colony vulnerability to poisons during famine relief might be mitigated by the dilution of food from the same source through mixing the concentration of food in workers positioned midway between the colony centre and its periphery and the existence of living silos the latter are expendable foragers who stay inside the nest and store food during famine relief thus acting as potential disposable testers for food toxicity c the association for the study of animal behaviour
ultrastructure of the thoracic dorso medial field tdm in the elytra to body arresting mechanism in tenebrionid beetles coleoptera tenebrionidae ||||| beetles with flying ability lock their elytra forewings to the thorax or and abdomen using complex locking devices these structures are often supplemented with microtrichia fields of the inner surface of the elytra and adjacent parts of the pterothorax the present study provides information about the ultrastructure of microtrichia of the dorso medial fields of the thorax tdm in tenebrionid beetles tribolium castaneum zophobas rugipes epidermal cells located under the tdm field contain large electron lucent vesicles connected to rough endoplasmic reticulum microtrichia and underlying cuticle of the tdm have a high density of pore channels which are responsible for transport of an epidermal secretion onto the tdm surface in order to show the presence of the secretion on the cuticle surface tdm fields of air dried specimens were compared with those in specimens after two treatments such as dehydration in ethanol and acetone and dental wax cast technique applied to living beetles this revealed the presence of the nonvolatile film on the intact microtrichial surface possible functions of this film are suggested to be the increase of adhesive forces in the contact area and providing soft coupling and release of two corresponding parts of the elytra locking device j morphol c wiley liss inc
convergence of specialised behaviour eye movements and visual optics in the sandlance teleostei and the chameleon reptilia ||||| chameleons have a number of unusual highly specialised visual features including telescopic visual optics with a reduced lens power wide separation of the eye s nodal point from the axis of rotation a deep pit fovea rapid pre calculated strikes for prey based on monocular depth judgements including focus and a complex pattern of partially independent alternating eye movements the same set of features has been acquired independently by a teleost the sandlance limnichthyes fasciatus despite its underwater lifestyle this fish displays visual behaviour and rapid strikes for prey that are remarkably similar to those of the chameleon in a direct comparison of the two species we have revealed other previously unsuspected similarities such as corneal accommodation which was unknown in teleosts as well as bringing together for the first time data collected from both species the sandlance is the only teleost among thousands studied that has corneal refraction corneal accommodation and reduced lens power as well as sharing the other specialised optical features seen in chameleons the independent eye movement pattern in the sandlance is also unusual and similar to that of the chameleon the selection pressures that have produced this remarkable example of convergence may relate to common visual constraints in the life styles of these two phylogenetically disparate species
fighting bacterial fire with bacterial fire ||||| microbiologywork presented last week at the annual meeting of the american society for cell biology in san francisco suggests that applying a harmless bacterium or its products to surgical wounds may thwart infections by the dangerous pathogen staphylococcus aureus a major cause of hospital acquired infections although physicians have previously pitted one bacterium against another to prevent infections of the intestinal and genitourinary tracts this is the first attempt to use a friendly microbe to prevent infection of surgical wounds say experts the findings also point to a possible mechanism for this bacterial interference they suggest that a protein secreted by the harmless bacterium prevents the pathogen from getting a foothold in injured tissue
biofouling lessons from nature ||||| biofouling is generally undesirable for many applications an overview of the medical marine and industrial fields susceptible to fouling is presented two types of fouling include biofouling from organism colonization and inorganic fouling from non living particles nature offers many solutions to control fouling through various physical and chemical control mechanisms examples include low drag low adhesion wettability water repellency and attraction microtexture grooming sloughing various miscellaneous behaviours and chemical secretions a survey of nature s flora and fauna was taken in order to discover new antifouling methods that could be mimicked for engineering applications antifouling methods currently employed ranging from coatings to cleaning techniques are described new antifouling methods will presumably incorporate a combination of physical and chemical controls
the suctorial organ of the solifugae arachnida solifugae ||||| the ability of members of the arachnid order solifugae to climb smooth vertical surfaces and the organs involved in this behavior are investigated macroscopic microscopic and scanning electron microscopic observations are made of a palpal organ called the suctorial organ observations of the behavior but not the microstructure have been made in the past histological examination illustrates the internal gross anatomy of this structure and scanning electron microscopy demonstrates the fine structure in adults of four genera eremobates eremobatidae eremochelis eremobatidae eremorhax eremobatidae ammotrechula ammotrechidae as well as an unidentified late stage immature and third stage instar the suctorial organ is most likely primarily used for prey capture in the wild q elsevier ltd all rights reserved
pollination efficiency and the evolution of specialized deceptive pollination systems ||||| the ultimate causes of evolution of highly specialized pollination systems are little understood we investigated the relationship between specialization and pollination efficiency defined as the proportion of pollinated flowers relative to those that experienced pollen removal using orchids with different pollination strategies as a model system rewarding orchids showed the highest pollination efficiency sexually deceptive orchids had comparably high pollination efficiency but food deceptive orchids had significantly lower efficiency values for pollinator sharing a measure of the degree of generalization in pollination systems showed the reverse pattern in that groups with high pollination efficiency had low values of pollinator sharing low pollinator sharing may thus be the basis for efficient pollination population genetic data indicated that both food and sexually deceptive species have higher degrees of among population gene flow than do rewarding orchids thus the shift from food to sexual deception may be driven by selection for more efficient pollination without compromising the high levels of gene flow that are characteristic of deceptive species
deployment of hagfish slime thread skeins requires the transmission of mixing forces via mucin strands ||||| summary hagfishes are benthic marine protovertebrates that secrete copious quantities of slime when threatened the slime originates as a two component glandular exudate comprised of coiled bundles of cytoskeletal intermediate filaments thread skeins and mucin vesicles holocrine secretion of the slime into seawater results in the rapid deployment of both fibrous and mucin components resulting in about a liter of dilute slime deployment of the thread skeins involves their unraveling in a fraction of a second from a mm long ellipsoid bundle to a thread that is x longer we hypothesized that thread skein deployment requires both vigorous hydrodynamic mixing and the presence of mucin vesicles both of which are required for whole slime deployment here we provide evidence that mixing and mucin vesicles are indeed crucial for skein unraveling specifically we show that mucin vesicles mixed into seawater swell and elongate into high aspect ratio mucin strands that attach to the thread skeins transmit hydrodynamic forces to them and effect their unraveling by loading them in tension our discovery of mucin strands in hagfish slime not only provides a mechanism for the rapid deployment of thread skeins in vivo it also helps explain how hagfish slime is able to trap such impressive volumes of seawater via viscous entrainment we believe that the deployment of thread skeins via their interaction with shear elongated mucins represents a unique mechanism in biology and may lead to novel technologies for transmitting hydrodynamic forces to microscale particles that would typically be immune to such forces
a biological solution to a fundamental distributed computing problem ||||| modeling of development in the fruit fly yields an algorithm useful in designing wireless communication networks computational and biological systems are often distributed so that processors cells jointly solve a task without any of them receiving all inputs or observing all outputs maximal independent set mis selection is a fundamental distributed computing procedure that seeks to elect a set of local leaders in a network a variant of this problem is solved during the development of the fly s nervous system when sensory organ precursor sop cells are chosen by studying sop selection we derived a fast algorithm for mis selection that combines two attractive features first processors do not need to know their degree second it has an optimal message complexity while only using one bit messages our findings suggest that simple and efficient algorithms can be developed on the basis of biologically derived insights
convergent evolution in mechanical design of lamnid sharks and tunas ||||| the evolution of thunniform body shapes in several different groups of vertebrates including whales ichthyosaurs and several species of large pelagic fishes supports the view that physical and hydromechanical demands provided important selection pressures to optimize body design for locomotion during vertebrate evolution recognition of morphological similarities between lamnid sharks the most well known being the great white and the mako and tunas has led to a general expectation that they also have converged in their functional design however no quantitative data exist on the mechanical performance of the locomotor system in lamnid sharks here we examine the swimming kinematics in vivo muscle dynamics and functional morphology of the force transmission system in a lamnid shark and show that the evolutionary convergence in body shape and mechanical design between the distantly related lamnids and tunas is much more than skin deep it extends to the depths of the myotendinous architecture and the mechanical basis for propulsive movements we demonstrate that not only have lamnids and tunas converged to a much greater extent than previously known but they have also developed morphological and functional adaptations in their locomotor systems that are unlike virtually all other fishes
design and mechanical properties of insect cuticle ||||| since nearly all adult insects fly the cuticle has to provide a very efficient and lightweight skeleton information is available about the mechanical properties of cuticle young s modulus of resilin is about mpa of soft cuticles about kpa to mpa of sclerotised cuticles gpa vicker s hardness of sclerotised cuticle ranges between and kgf mm density is kg m and one of its components chitin nanofibres the young s modulus of which is more than gpa experiments based on fracture mechanics have not been performed although the layered structure probably provides some toughening the structural performance of wings and legs has been measured but our understanding of the importance of buckling is lacking it can stiffen the structure by elastic postbuckling in wings for example or be a failure mode we know nothing of fatigue properties yet for instance the insect wing must undergo millions of cycles flexing or buckling on each cycle the remarkable mechanical performance and efficiency of cuticle can be analysed and compared with those of other materials using material property charts and material indices presented in this paper are four young s modulus density stiffness per unit weight specific young s modulus specific strength elastic hinges elastic energy storage per unit weight toughness young s modulus fracture resistance under various loading conditions and hardness wear resistance in conjunction with a structural analysis of cuticle these charts help to understand the relevance of microstructure fibre orientation effects in tendons joints and sense organs for example and shape including surface structure of this fibrous composite for a given function with modern techniques for analysis of structure and material and emphasis on nanocomposites and self assembly insect cuticle should be the archetype for composites at all levels of scale
resolution of experimentally induced symmetrical conflicts of interest in meerkats ||||| changes in activity in animal groups are a potential source of group fragmentation if members do not coordinate themselves this coordination can become further complicated when individuals within a group face conflicts of interest we experimentally induced symmetrical conflicts of interest over which direction to choose in meerkat suricata suricatta groups we trained dominant and subordinate individuals to expect food at locations in opposite directions when the group was still at its sleeping burrow i e before the group started foraging trained individuals were more likely to initiate group departure in the direction of their rewarded location and there was no difference between dominants and subordinates in initiation rate initiation of group departure seemed to be the most important factor determining the final direction of the group as the direction chosen by the first initiator was rarely challenged we did not observe any obvious signals used to enhance recruitment during this process over the experimental days initiator identity changed suggesting that individual motivation to initiate group departure varies from day to day meerkats voluntarily avoided immediate foraging benefits to maintain cohesion with the group which probably prevented them from incurring costs associated with becoming isolated we conclude that individuals refrain from initiating group splits when conflicts of interest are low and any individual can take the lead often without the use of obvious signals other than the displacement itself
high speed microscopic imaging of flagella motility and swimming in giardia lamblia trophozoites ||||| we report in this paper several findings about the swimming and attachment mechanisms of giardia lamblia trophozoites these data were collected using a combination of a high contrast cytoviva imaging system and a particle image velocimetry camera which can capture images at speeds greater than frames s using this system we discovered that during rapid swimming of giardia trophozoites undulations of the caudal region contributed to forward propulsion combined with the beating of the flagella pairs it was also discovered in contrast to previous studies with times slower image sampling technique that the anterior and posterolateral flagella beat with a clearly defined power stroke and not symmetrical undulations during the transition from free swimming to attachment trophozoites modified their swimming behavior from a rapid rotating motion to a more stable planar swimming while using this planar swimming motion the trophozoites used the flagella for propulsion and directional control in addition to examination of the posterolateral and anterior flagella a model to describe the motion of the ventral flagella was derived indicating that the ventral flagella beat in an expanding sine wave in addition the structure of the ventrocaudal groove creates boundary conditions that determine the form of beating of the ventral flagella the results from this study indicate that giardia is able to simultaneously generate both ciliary beating and typical eukaryotic flagellar beating using different pairs of flagella
landscape scale carbon storage associated with beaver dams ||||| beaver meadows form when beaver dams promote prolonged overbank flooding and floodplain retention of sediment and organic matter extensive beaver meadows form in broad low gradient valley segments upstream from glacial terminal moraines surveyed sediment volume and total organic carbon content in beaver meadows on the eastern side of rocky mountain national park are extrapolated to create a first order approximation of landscape scale carbon storage in these meadows relative to adjacent uplands differences in total organic carbon between abandoned and active beaver meadows suggest that valley bottom carbon storage has declined substantially as beaver have disappeared and meadows have dried relict beaver meadows represent of total carbon storage within the landscape but the value was closer to when beaver actively maintained wet meadows these changes reflect the general magnitude of cumulative effects in heterotrophic respiration and organic matter oxidation associated with historical declines in beaver populations across the continent
mechanisms in failure prevention of bio materials and bio structures ||||| abstract nature is replete with examples of layered structure materials that are evolved through billions of years to provide high performance insect elytra a portion of the exoskeleton have evoked worldwide research attention and are believed to serve as fuselages and wings of natural aircraft this work focuses on the relationship between structure mechanical behavior and failure mechanisms of the elytra we report a failure mode optimization fmo mechanism that can explain elytra s mechanical behaviors we show initial evidence that this mechanism makes bio structures of low strength materials strong and ductile that can effectively resist shear forces and crack growth a bio inspired design of a joint by using the fmo mechanism has been proved by experiments to have a potential to increase the interface shear strength as high as about times the fmo mechanism which is based on the new concept of property structure synergetic coupling proposed in this work offer some thoughts to deal with the notoriously difficult problem of interface strength and to reduce catastrophic failure events
chemistry specific interfacial forces between barnacle semibalanus balanoides cyprid footprint proteins and chemically functionalised afm tips ||||| cypris larvae of the barnacle semibalanus balanoides leave proteinaceous footprints on surfaces during pre settlement exploration these footprints are considered to mediate temporary adhesion of cyprids to substrata and as such represent a crucial first step in the colonization of man made surfaces by barnacles a process known as biofouling interest in this system also stems from the potential for a synthetic reversible adhesion system based on the strategy used by cyprids cyprid footprints were probed using atomic force microscopy afm and nanomechanical data relating to interfacial adhesion forces were correlated with afm tip chemistry commercial si n tips and chemically functionalized ch tips were chosen to mimic the interactions of cyprid footprints with hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces respectively force extension curves of protein bundles picked up by afm tips exhibited a characteristic saw tooth appearance for both types of tip but demonstrated clear differences relating to pull off force and pull off length based on tip chemistry additional nn interfacial adhesion forces between ch functionalized tips and footprints were assigned to hydrophobic interactions footprint proteins adhered with greater tenacity to the hydrophobic tip this may suggest conformational change and denaturing of the protein which would facilitate hydrophobic interaction by enhancing contact forces between ch functionalized tips and hydrophobic groups in the footprint molecule s neither tip removed proteins from the nh substratum suggesting that specific chemical interactions rather than simple wetting phenomena govern the adhesion of footprint proteins to that surface
assembly mechanism of recombinant spider silk proteins ||||| spider silk threads are formed by the irreversible aggregation of silk proteins in a spinning duct with dimensions of only a few micrometers here we present a microfluidic device in which engineered and recombinantly produced spider dragline silk proteins eadf engineered araneus diadematus fibroin and eadf are assembled into fibers our approach allows the direct observation and identification of the essential parameters of dragline silk assembly changes in ionic conditions and ph result in aggregation of the two proteins assembly of eadf fibers was induced only in the presence of an elongational flow component strikingly eadf formed fibers only in combination with eadf on the basis of these results we propose a model for dragline silk aggregation and early steps of fiber assembly in the microscopic regime
insect metabolism preventing cyanide release from leaves ||||| organisms that produce hydrogen cyanide gas to protect themselves against predators can do so by the enzymatic breakdown of a class of compounds known as cyanogens such as cyanogenic glycosides here we show how a neotropical butterfly heliconius sara can avoid the harmful effects of the cyanogenic leaves of passiflora auriculata passion vine on which its larvae feed exclusively to our knowledge this is the first example of an insect that is able to metabolize cyanogens and thereby prevent the release of cyanide the mechanistic details of this pathway might suggest new ways to make cyanogenic crops more useful as a food source
intracellular invasion of green algae in a salamander host ||||| the association between embryos of the spotted salamander ambystoma maculatum and green algae oophila amblystomatis lamber ex printz has been considered an ectosymbiotic mutualism we show here however that this symbiosis is more intimate than previously reported a combination of imaging and algal s rdna amplification reveals algal invasion of embryonic salamander tissues and cells during development algal cells are detectable from embryonic and larval stages through chlorophyll autofluorescence and algal s rdna amplification algal cell ultrastructure indicates both degradation and putative encystment during the process of tissue and cellular invasion fewer algal cells were detected in later stage larvae through fish suggesting that the decline in autofluorescent cells is primarily due to algal cell death within the host however early embryonic egg capsules also contained encysted algal cells on the inner capsule wall and algal s rdna was amplified from adult reproductive tracts consistent with oviductal transmission of algae from one salamander generation to the next the invasion of algae into salamander host tissues and cells represents a unique association between a vertebrate and a eukaryotic alga with implications for research into cell cell recognition possible exchange of metabolites or dna and potential congruence between host and symbiont population structures
energy storage and synchronisation of hind leg movements during jumping in planthopper insects hemiptera issidae ||||| summary the hind legs of issus hemiptera issidae move in the same plane underneath the body an arrangement that means they must also move synchronously to power jumping moreover they move so quickly that energy must be stored before a jump and then released suddenly high speed imaging and analysis of the mechanics of the proximal joints of the hind legs show that mechanical mechanisms ensure both synchrony of movements and energy storage the hind trochantera move first in jumping and are synchronised to within ms synchrony is achieved by mechanical interactions between small protrusions from each trochantera which fluoresce bright blue under specific wavelengths of ultra violet light and which touch at the midline when the legs are cocked before a jump in dead issus a depression force applied to a cocked hind leg or to the tendon of its trochanteral depressor muscle causes a simultaneous depression of both hind legs the protrusion of the hind leg that moves first nudges the other hind leg so that both move synchronously contractions of the trochanteral depressor muscles that precede a jump bend the metathoracic pleural arches of the internal skeleton large areas of these bow shaped structures fluoresce bright blue in ultraviolet light and the intensity of this fluorescence depends on the ph of the bathing saline these are key signatures of the rubber like protein resilin the remainder of a pleural arch consists of stiff cuticle bending these composite structures stores energy and their recoil powers jumping
blood flow to appendages and the control of heat exchange in american alligators ||||| small american alligators g were heated and cooled from to to c in a temperature controlled wind tunnel blood flow to the limbs and tail was periodically occluded using remotely controlled occlusion cuffs when blood flow in all appendages was occluded the rate of heating was significantly reduced from that when blood flow was unrestricted the rate of cooling was not significantly affected by occlusion of blood flow in all appendages however blood flow to appendages rather than a generalized perfusion of the skin appears to be primarily responsible for the differences in the rates of heating and cooling in alligators
dynamics of leg muscle function in tammar wallabies m eugenii during level versus incline hopping ||||| summary the goal of our study was to examine whether the in vivo force length behavior work and elastic energy savings of distal muscle tendon units in the legs of tammar wallabies macropus eugenii change during level versus incline hopping to address this question we obtained measurements of muscle activation via electromyography fascicle strain via sonomicrometry and muscle tendon force via tendon buckles from the lateral gastrocnemius lg and plantaris pl muscles of tammar wallabies trained to hop on a level and an inclined deg grade treadmill at two speeds m s and m s similar patterns of muscle activation force and fascicle strain were observed under both level and incline conditions this also corresponded to similar patterns of limb timing and movement duty factor limb contact time and hopping frequency during both level and incline hopping the lg and pl exhibited patterns of fascicle stretch and shortening that yielded low levels of net fascicle strain lg level mean s e m vs incline pl level vs incline and muscle work lg level j kg muscle vs incline j kg muscle pl level j kg muscle vs incline j kg muscle consequently neither muscle significantly altered its contractile dynamics to do more work during incline hopping whereas electromyographic emg phase duration and intensity did not differ for the lg the pl exhibited shorter but more intense periods of activation together with reduced emg phase p during incline versus level hopping our results indicate that design for spring like tendon energy savings and economical muscle force generation is key for these two distal muscle tendon units of the tammar wallaby and the need to accommodate changes in work associated with level versus incline locomotion is achieved by more proximal muscles of the limb
a dinoflagellate exploits toxins to immobilize prey prior to ingestion ||||| toxins produced by the harmful algal bloom hab forming mixotrophic dinoflagellate karlodinium veneficum have long been associated with fish kills to date the perceived ecological role for toxins has been relief from grazing pressures here we demonstrate that karlotoxins also serve as a predation instrument using high speed holographic microscopy we measure the swimming behavior of several toxic and nontoxic strains of k veneficum and their prey storeatula major within dense suspensions the selected strains produce toxins with varying potency and dosages including a nontoxic one results clearly show that mixing the prey with the predatory toxic strains causes prey immobilization at rates that are consistent with the karlotoxins potency and dosage even prey cells that continue swimming slow down after exposure to toxic predators the swimming characteristics of predators vary substantially in pure suspensions as quantified by their velocity radii of helical trajectories and direction of helical rotation when mixed with prey all toxic strains that are involved in predation slow down furthermore they substantially reduced their predominantly vertical migration presumably to remain in the vicinity of their prey conversely the nontoxic control strain does not alter its swimming and does not affect prey behavior in separate experiments we show that exposing prey to exogenous toxins also causes prey immobilization at rates consistent with potency clearly the toxic predatory strains use karlotoxins as a means of stunning their prey before ingesting it these findings add a substantiated critical understanding for why some hab species produce such complex toxin molecules

elastic response of the resurrection fern polypodium polypodioides during rehydration ||||| the resurrection fern polypodium polypodioides has a remarkable elastic reponse where the fast water uptake of the fern upon rehydration is accompanied by a significant reduction in its young s modulus in this letter we discuss the fern s elastic response and suggest that by mimicking its structure one should be able to design materials exhibiting interesting elastic behavior
deconstruction for reconstruction the role of proteolysis in neural plasticity and disease ||||| the brain changes in response to experience and altered environment this neural plasticity is largely mediated by morphological and functional modification of synapses a process that depends on both synthesis and degradation of proteins it is now clear that regulated proteolysis plays a critical role in the remodeling of synapses learning and memory and neurodevelopment here we highlight the mechanisms and functions of proteolysis in synaptic plasticity and discuss its alteration in disease states
seasonal adjustment of solar heat gain independent of coat coloration in a desert mammal ||||| despite the apparent importance of solar radiation as a source of heat for free living animals there exists no substantial body of empirical data describing physiological responses to solar radiation under the range of convective conditions likely to occur in nature we therefore quantified effects of simulated solar radiation and wind on metabolic heat production in the rock squirrel spermophilus variegatus this diurnal mammal inhabits the sonoran desert and seasonally replaces its pelage in a fashion in which it retains constant external appearance but incorporates optical and structural changes that are thought to significantly alter heat transfer properties of the coat at a given wind speed the presence of w m of simulated solar radiation reduces metabolic heat production by at a wind speed of m s to at a wind speed of m s independent of effects of irradiance metabolic heat production significantly increases with wind speed such that as wind speed is increased from m s to m s metabolic heat production is elevated by sunlight absent or sunlight present previous analyses demonstrated that when exposed to identical radiative and convective environments rock squirrels with summer pelages accrue solar heat loads lower than those experienced by animals with winter coats this reduction of solar heat gain during the extremely hot sonoran desert summer apparently constitutes a previously unappreciated mode of thermal adaptation by seasonal adjustment of radiative heat gain without changes in the animal s appearance
why the seahorse tail is square ||||| the curious tale of the square tail appendages in animals are typically round but the seahorse tail has a square cross section porter et al hypothesize that this shape provides better functionality and strength than a round cross section see the perspective by ashley ross three dimensional printed models show that square cross section shapes behave more advantageously when subjected to compressive forces by allowing greater deformation without damage and accommodating twisting deformations square appendages passively return to their original configurations the added flexibility of the square cross section enhances the tail s ability to grasp objects science this issue science aaa see also p d printed models show that square profile seahorse tails have better crush resistance and grasping ability than do circular ones also see perspective by ashley ross introduction although the predominant shapes of most animal tails are cylindrical seahorse tails are square prisms the skeleton of their tails consists of a bony armor arranged into several ringlike segments composed of four l shaped plates that surround a central vertebra these plates articulate with specialized joints that facilitate bending and twisting as well as resist vertebral fracture from crushing muscles attached to the vertebral column transmit forces to the bony plates to provide motion for grasping and holding on to objects such as sea grasses mangrove roots and coral reefs which allows them to hide and rely on camouflage when evading predators and capturing prey rationale we hypothesize that the square cross sectional architecture of a seahorse tail improves mechanical performance in prehension grasping ability and armored functions crushing resistance relative to a cylindrical one to test this hypothesis we evaluated the mechanics of two three dimensional d printed prototypes composed of articulating plates and vertebrae that mimic the natural square prism and a hypothetical cylindrical tail structure we compared the bending twisting and compressive behavior of the biomimetic prototypes to show that the square profile is better than the circular one for two integrated functions grasping ability and crushing resistance results seahorse tails and the prototypes have three primary joints that enable motion ball and socket peg and socket and gliding the ball and socket joints connect adjacent vertebrae and constrain bending in both the square and cylindrical prototypes to the same degree exhibiting a behavior similar to that of a natural seahorse tail the peg and socket joints connect the plates of adjacent segments and substantially restrict twisting in the prototype with a square profile as compared with the circular one the square geometry limits excessive torsion and preserves articulatory organization which could provide seahorses a natural safety factor against torsion induced damage and assist in tail relaxation further the square architecture is flat increasing surface contact and undergoes an exterior shape change when twisted which could allow seahorses to grasp objects with more control gliding joints are present at the plate overlaps along all four sides of both prototypes under transverse compression and impact with a rubber mallet the plates of the square prototype slide past one another with one degree of translation freedom analogous to the crushing behavior of a natural seahorse tail exhibiting a response that is stiffer stronger and more resilient than its cylindrical counterpart whose plates translate and rotate on impact conclusion exploration of these biologically inspired designs provides insight into the mechanical benefits for seahorses to have evolved prehensile tails composed of armored plates organized into square prisms beyond their intended practical applications engineering designs are convenient means to answer elusive biological questions when live animal data are unavailable for example seahorses do not have cylindrical tails understanding the role of mechanics in these prototypes may help engineers to develop future seahorse inspired technologies that mimic the prehensile and armored functions of the natural appendage for a variety of applications in robotics defense systems or biomedicine engineering designs answer biological questions d printed models that mimic a seahorse tail were designed not only for potential engineering applications but also to answer the biological question why might tails organized into square prisms be better than cylinders a mechanical comparison of the prototypes shows that articulated square prisms perform better than do cylinders for grasping and resistance to crushing whereas the predominant shapes of most animal tails are cylindrical seahorse tails are square prisms seahorses use their tails as flexible grasping appendages in spite of a rigid bony armor that fully encases their bodies we explore the mechanics of two three dimensional printed models that mimic either the natural square prism or hypothetical cylindrical architecture of a seahorse tail to uncover whether or not the square geometry provides any functional advantages our results show that the square prism is more resilient when crushed and provides a mechanism for preserving

the function of the sawfish s saw ||||| summary jawed fishes that possess an elongated rostrum use it to either sense prey or to manipulate it but not for both the billfish rostrum for instance lacks any sensory function and is used to stun prey while paddlefishes use their rostrum to detect and orient towards electric fields of plankton sturgeons search through the substrate with their electroreceptive rostrum and engulf prey by oral suction here we show that juvenile freshwater sawfish pristis microdon are active predators that use their toothed rostrum the saw to both sense prey simulating electric fields and capture prey prey encountered in the water column is attacked with lateral swipes of the saw that can stun and or impale it we compare sawfish to shovelnose rays which share a common shovelnose ray like ancestor and lack a saw
molecular basis of infrared detection by snakes ||||| snakes possess a unique sensory system for detecting infrared radiation enabling them to generate a thermal image of predators or prey infrared signals are initially received by the pit organ a highly specialized facial structure that is innervated by nerve fibres of the somatosensory system how this organ detects and transduces infrared signals into nerve impulses is not known here we use an unbiased transcriptional profiling approach to identify trpa channels as infrared receptors on sensory nerve fibres that innervate the pit organ trpa orthologues from pit bearing snakes vipers pythons and boas are the most heat sensitive vertebrate ion channels thus far identified consistent with their role as primary transducers of infrared stimuli thus snakes detect infrared signals through a mechanism involving radiant heating of the pit organ rather than photochemical transduction these findings illustrate the broad evolutionary tuning of transient receptor potential trp channels as thermosensors in the vertebrate nervous system
cold adapted tubulins in the glacier ice worm mesenchytraeus solifugus ||||| glacier ice worms mesenchytraeus solifugus and related species are the only known annelids that survive obligately in glacier ice and snow one fundamental component of cold temperature adaptation is the ability to polymerize tubulin which typically depolymerizes at low physiological temperatures e g degrees c in most temperate species in this study we isolated two alpha tubulin msalpha msalpha and two beta tubulin msbeta msbeta subunits from an ice worm cdna library and compared their predicted amino acid sequences with homologues from other cold adapted organisms e g antarctic fish ciliate in an effort to identify species specific amino acid substitutions that contribute to cold temperature dependent tubulin polymerization our comparisons and predicted protein structures suggest that ice worm specific amino acid substitutions stabilize lateral contact associations particularly between beta tubulin protofilaments but these substitutions occur at different positions in comparison with other cold adapted tubulins the ice worm tubulin gene family appears relatively small comprising one primary alpha and one primary beta tubulin monomers though minor isoforms and pseudogenes were identified our analyses suggest that variation occurs in the strategies i e species specific amino acid substitutions gene number by which cold adapted taxa have evolved the ability to polymerize tubulin at low physiological temperatures
evidence for an elastic projection mechanism in the chameleon tongue ||||| to capture prey chameleons ballistically project their tongues as far as body lengths with accelerations of up to m s at the core of a chameleon s tongue is a cylindrical tongue skeleton surrounded by the accelerator muscle previously the cylindrical accelerator muscle was assumed to power tongue projection directly during the actual fast projection of the tongue however high speed recordings of chamaeleo melleri and c pardalis reveal that peak powers of w kg are necessary to generate the observed accelerations which exceed the accelerator muscle s capacity by at least five to fold extrinsic structures might power projection via the tongue skeleton high speed fluoroscopy suggests that they contribute less than of the required peak instantaneous power thus the projection power must be generated predominantly within the tongue and an energy storage and release mechanism must be at work the key structure in the projection mechanism is probably a cylindrical connective tissue layer which surrounds the entoglossal process and was previously suggested to act as lubricating tissue this tissue layer comprises at least sheaths that envelop the entoglossal process the outer portion connects anteriorly to the accelerator muscle and the inner portion to the retractor structures the sheaths contain helical arrays of collagen fibres prior to projection the sheaths are longitudinally loaded by the combined radial contraction and hydrostatic lengthening of the accelerator muscle at an estimated mean power of w kg in c melleri tongue projection is triggered as the accelerator muscle and the loaded portions of the sheaths start to slide over the tip of the entoglossal process the springs relax radially while pushing off the rounded tip of the entoglossal process making the elastic energy stored in the helical fibres available for a simultaneous forward acceleration of the tongue pad accelerator muscle and retractor structures the energy release continues as the multilayered spring slides over the tip of the smooth and lubricated entoglossal process this sliding spring theory predicts that the sheaths deliver most of the instantaneous power required for tongue projection the release power of the sliding tubular springs exceeds the work rate of the accelerator muscle by at least a factor of because the elastic energy release occurs much faster than the loading process thus we have identified a unique catapult mechanism that is very different from standard engineering designs our morphological and kinematic observations as well as the available literature data are consistent with the proposed mechanism of tongue projection although experimental tests of the sheath strain and the lubrication of the entoglossal process are currently beyond our technical scope
structure and dynamics of cross linked actin networks ||||| the actin cytoskeleton a network of protein polymers is responsible for the mechanical stability of cells this biopolymer network is also crucial for processes that require spatial and temporal variations in the network structure such as cell migration division and intracellular transport the cytoskeleton therefore has to combine structural integrity and mechanical stability with the possibility of fast and efficient network reorganization and restructuring cells meet this challenge by using proteins to link filamentous actin f actin and construct complex networks the molecular properties of the cross linking proteins determine to a large extent the micro structure viscoelastic properties and dynamics of the resulting networks this review focuses on the structural polymorphism that can be induced by cross linking proteins in reconstituted f actin networks and summarizes recent results on how the molecular properties of cross linking proteins dictate the ensuing viscoelastic properties
circadian regulation of bioluminescence in the prey luring glowworm arachnocampa flava ||||| the glowworms of new zealand and australia are bioluminescent fly larvae that generate light to attract prey into their webs some species inhabit the constant darkness of caves as well as the dim natural photophase of rain forests given the diversity of light regimens experienced by glowworms in their natural environment true circadian rhythmicity of light output could be present consequently the light emission characteristics of the australian subtropical species arachnocampa flava both in their natural rainforest habitat and in artificial conditions in the laboratory were established larvae were taken from rainforest and kept alive in individual containers when placed in constant darkness dd in the laboratory they maintained free running cyclical light output for at least days indicating that light output is regulated by an endogenous rhythm the characteristics of the light emission changed in dd individuals showed an increase in the time spent glowing per day and a reduction in the maximum light output most individuals show a free running period greater than h manipulation of the photophase and exposure to skeleton photoperiods showed that light acts as both a masking and an entraining agent and suggests that the underlying circadian rhythm is sinusoidal in the absence of light based masking manipulation of thermoperiod in dd showed that temperature cycles are an alternative entraining agent exposure to a period of daily feeding in dd failed to entrain the rhythm in the laboratory the endogenous regulation of luminescence poses questions about periodicity and synchronization of bioluminescence in cave glowworms
passive propulsion in vortex wakes ||||| a dead fish is propelled upstream when its flexible body resonates with oncoming vortices formed in the wake of a bluff cylinder despite being well outside the suction region of the cylinder within this passive propulsion mode the body of the fish extracts sufficient energy from the oncoming vortices to develop thrust to overcome its own drag in a similar turbulent wake and at roughly the same distance behind a bluff cylinder a passively mounted high aspect ratio foil is also shown to propel itself upstream employing a similar flow energy extraction mechanism in this case mechanical energy is extracted from the flow at the same time that thrust is produced these results prove experimentally that under proper conditions a body can follow at a distance or even catch up to another upstream body without expending any energy of its own this observation is also significant in the development of low drag energy harvesting devices and in the energetics of fish dwelling in flowing water and swimming behind wake forming obstacles
a unique resource mutualism between the giant bornean pitcher plant nepenthes rajah and members of a small mammal community ||||| the carnivorous pitcher plant genus nepenthes grows in nutrient deficient substrates and produce jug shaped leaf organs pitchers that trap arthropods as a source of n and p a number of bornean nepenthes demonstrate novel nutrient acquisition strategies notably three giant montane species are engaged in a mutualistic association with the mountain treeshrew tupaia montana in which the treeshrew defecates into the pitchers while visiting them to feed on nectar secretions on the pitchers lids although the basis of this resource mutualism has been elucidated many aspects are yet to be investigated we sought to provide insights into the value of the mutualism to each participant during initial observations we discovered that the summit rat r baluensis also feeds on sugary exudates of n rajah pitchers and defecates into them and that this behavior appears to be habitual the scope of the study was therefore expanded to assess to what degree n rajah interacts with the small mammal community we found that both t montana and r baluensis are engaged in a mutualistic interaction with n rajah t montana visit pitchers more frequently than r baluensis but daily scat deposition rates within pitchers do not differ suggesting that the mutualistic relationships are of a similar strength this study is the first to demonstrate that a mutualism exists between a carnivorous plant species and multiple members of a small mammal community further the newly discovered mutualism between r baluensis and n rajah represents only the second ever example of a multidirectional resource based mutualism between a mammal and a carnivorous plant
evolution of restraint in a structured rock paper scissors community ||||| it is not immediately clear how costly behavior that benefits others evolves by natural selection by saving on inherent costs individuals that do not contribute socially have a selective advantage over altruists if both types receive equal benefits restrained consumption of a common resource is a form of altruism the cost of this kind of prudent behavior is that restrained individuals give up resources to less restrained individuals the benefit of restraint is that better resource management may prolong the persistence of the group one way to dodge the problem of defection is for altruists to interact disproportionately with other altruists with limited dispersal restrained individuals persist because of interaction with like types whereas it is the unrestrained individuals that must face the negative long term consequences of their rapacity here we study the evolution of restraint in a community of three competitors exhibiting a nontransitive rock paper scissors relationship the nontransitivity ensures a form of negative feedback whereby improvement in growth of one competitor has the counterintuitive consequence of lowering the density of that improved player this negative feedback generates detrimental long term consequences for unrestrained growth using both computer simulations and evolution experiments with a nontransitive community of escherichia coli we find that restrained growth can evolve under conditions of limited dispersal in which negative feedback is present this research thus highlights a set of ecological conditions sufficient for the evolution of one form of altruism
insects had it first surfactants as a defence against predators ||||| insects have evolved an astonishing array of defences to ward off enemies well known and widespread is the regurgitation of oral secretion os fluid that repels attacking predators in herbivores the effectiveness of os has been ascribed so far to the presence of deterrent secondary metabolites sequestered from the host plant this notion implies however that generalists experience less protection on plants with low amounts of secondary metabolites or with compounds ineffective against potential enemies resolving the dilemma we describe a novel defence mechanism that is independent of deterrents as it relies on the intrinsic detergent properties of the os the os of spodoptera exigua and other species was found to be highly amphiphilic and well capable of wetting the hydrophobic cuticle of predatory ants as a result affected ants stopped attacking and engaged in extensive cleansing the presence of surfactants was sufficient to explain the defensive character of herbivore os we hypothesize that detergency is a common but unrecognized mode of defence which provides a base level of protection that may or may not be further enhanced by plant derived deterrents our study also proves that insects invented the use of defensive surfactants long before modern agriculture had started applying them as insecticides
neurophysiology sensing temperature without ion channels ||||| mammals use cold sensitive ion channels to translate information about the temperature of their surroundings into electrical signals that are taken up by thermoreceptor nerve cells here i investigate the thermoelectric properties of an extracellular gel removed from the electrosensors of sharks and show that it develops significant voltages in response to tiny temperature gradients this bulk property of the gel indicates that temperature can be translated into electrical information without the need for ion channels a sensitivity that may help sharks to locate thermal fronts as feeding areas
how kelp produce blade shapes suited to different flow regimes a new wrinkle ||||| many species of macroalgae have flat strap like blades in habitats exposed to rapidly flowing water but have wide ruffled undulate blades at protected sites we used the giant bull kelp nereocystis luetkeana to investigate how these ecomorphological differences are produced the undulate blades of n luetkeana from sites with low flow remain spread out and flutter erratically in moving water thereby not only enhancing interception of light but also increasing drag in contrast strap like blades of kelp from habitats with rapid flow collapse into streamlined bundles and flutter at low amplitude in flowing water thus reducing both drag and interception of light transplant experiments in the field revealed that shape of the blade in n luetkeana is a plastic trait laboratory experiments in which growing blades from different sites were subjected to tensile forces that mimicked the hydrodynamic drag experienced by blades in different flow regimes showed that change in shape is induced by mechanical stress during growth experiments in the field and laboratory we mapped the spatial distribution of growth in both undulate and strap like blades to determine how these different morphologies were produced the highest growth rates occur near the proximal ends of n luetkeana blades of both morphologies but the rates of transverse growth of narrow strap like blades are lower than those of wide undulate blades if rates of longitudinal growth at the edges of a blade exceed the rate of longitudinal growth along the midline of the blade ruffles along the edges of the blade are produced by elastic buckling in contrast flat blades are produced when rates of longitudinal growth are similar across the width of a blade because ruffles are the result of elastic buckling a compliant undulate n luetkeana blade can easily be pushed into different configurations e g the wavelengths of the ruffles along the edges of the blade can change and the whole blade can twist into left and right handed helicoidal shapes which may enhance movements of the blade in flowing water that reduce self shading and increase mass exchange along blade surfaces
photoperiodic adjustments in immune function protect siberian hamsters from lethal endotoxemia ||||| seasonal changes in day length enhance or suppress components of immune function in individuals of several mammalian species siberian hamsters phodopus sungorus exhibit multiple changes in neuroendocrine reproductive and immune function after exposure to short days the manner in which these changes are integrated into the host response to pathogens is not well understood the present experiments tested the hypothesis that short day changes in immune function alter the pathogenesis of septic shock and survival after challenge with endotoxin male and female siberian hamsters raised in long day photoperiods were transferred as adults to short days or remained in their natal photoperiod six to weeks later hamsters were injected i p with or mg kg bacterial lipopolysaccharide lps the biologically active constituent of endotoxin and survival was monitored for h short days significantly improved survival of male hamsters treated with or mg kg lps and improved survival in females treated with mg kg lps transfer from long to short days shifted the ld in males by approximately from to mg kg and in females from to mg kg b long day females were more resistant than were males to lethal endotoxemia in vitro production of the proinflammatory cytokine tnfa in response to lps stimulation was significantly lower in macrophages extracted from short day relative to long day hamsters as were circulating concentrations of tnfa in vivo after i p administration of lps suggesting that diminished cytokine responses to lps in short days may mitigate the lethality of endotoxemia adaptation to short days induces changes in immune parameters that affect survival in the face of immune challenges
sun and shade leaves of olea europaea respond differently to plant size light availability and genetic variation ||||| canopy plasticity the expression of different leaf phenotypes within the crown of an individual tree has complex functional and evolutionary implications that remain to be thoroughly assessed we hypothesized that it can lead to disparity in how leaves in different positions of the canopy change with allometric growth and population genetic structure leaf phenotypes of the inner and outer canopy were estimated using eight morphological and physiological characters all traits were measured under field conditions in six populations of olea europaea and again in a common garden for a subset of the genotypes the same populations were characterized genetically with amplified fragment length polymorphisms aflp genomic scans with these data we investigated the extent to which leaf phenotypes change with plant size genetic processes and in response to environmental conditions inside and outside the canopy the size of trees measured in the field was clearly associated with the phenotype of sun but not to that of shade leaves the phenotype of sun leaves depended on both direct and diffuse light while that of shade leaves was found to correlate only with diffuse radiation additionally light availability inside the canopy was conditioned by the shape of external leaves and increasing elongation of sun leaves led to higher radiation in the inner canopy the field phenotypes of both inner and outer canopy leaves were correlated with genetic variation among populations conversely in the common garden the different genotypes expressed a homogeneous sun phenotype while phenotypic differences among populations remained apparent in shade leaves we conclude that in agreement with our working hypothesis canopy plasticity is both cause and consequence of the environment experienced by the plant and might lead to the differential expression of genetic polymorphisms among leaves furthermore we propose that it can contribute to buffer abiotic stress and to the partition of light use within the tree crown
the mammalian auditory hair cell a simple electric circuit model ||||| a model based on the potassium current pathway through the hair cell is used to analyze the electrical behavior of mammalian inner and outer hair cells without taking into account the effects of calcium it is possible to simulate experimental results concerning the shape and strength of the receptor potential and the frequency dependent ac alternating current and dc direct current components of the receptor current this model and a simplified form of it are utilized to explain transduction latencies that the receptor potential follows a stimulating signal with a very short delay under the assumption of a constant number of open k channels in the lateral part of the cell membrane transduction gains why higher potential changes are measured in inner hair cells than in outer hair cells although the outer hair cells are expected to be exposed to higher stereociliary motions in inner hair cells a decrease in the conductance of the basolateral membrane causes higher gain receptor potential increases and together with an increase of membrane capacitance slower reaction a larger time constant transduction channel kinetics that the shortest ms as well as the longest ms possible open times of the transduction channels in the stereocilia have different frequency related effects on the shape of the receptor potentials
the ontogenetic changes in the thermal properties of blubber from atlantic bottlenose dolphin tursiops truncatus ||||| summary in atlantic bottlenose dolphins tursiops truncatus both the thickness and lipid content of blubber vary across ontogeny and across individuals of differing reproductive and nutritional status this study investigates how these changes in blubber morphology and composition influence its thermal properties thermal conductivity w m deg where deg is degc and thermal insulation m deg w of dolphin blubber were measured in individuals across an ontogenetic series fetus through adult n pregnant females n and emaciated animals n these thermal properties were determined by the simultaneous use of two common experimental approaches the heat flux disc method and the standard material method thickness lipid and water content were measured for each blubber sample thermal conductivity and insulation varied significantly across ontogeny blubber from fetuses through sub adults was less conductive range w m deg than that of adults mean w m deg the conductivity of blubber from pregnant females was similar to non adult categories while that of emaciated animals was significantly higher w m deg than all other categories blubber from sub adults and pregnant females had the highest insulation values while fetuses and emaciated animals had the lowest in nutritionally dependant life history categories changes in blubber s thermal insulation were characterized by stable blubber quality i e conductivity and increased blubber quantity i e thickness in nutritionally independent animals blubber quantity remained stable while blubber quality varied a final unexpected observation was that heat flux measurements at the deep blubber surface were significantly higher than that at the superficial surface a pattern not observed in control materials this apparent ability to absorb heat coupled with blubber s fatty acid composition suggest that dolphin integument may function as a phase change material
physiological colour change in the hercules beetle ||||| the hercules beetle dynastes hercules l can change the colour of its elytra horny fore wings from black to greenish yellow and back again to black all within a few minutes it does this in a way previously unknown among insects apart from the reversible migrations of pigment granules in the iris cells physiological or rapidly reversible colour changes are very rare in insects among beetles coptocyclia aspidomorpha and many other cassidinae can change the colour of their elytra by varying the amount of water in the cuticle and thereby the thickness of the thin films responsible for the interference colours
sneeze to leave african wild dogs lycaon pictus use variable quorum thresholds facilitated by sneezes in collective decisions ||||| in despotically driven animal societies one or a few individuals tend to have a disproportionate influence on group decision making and actions however global communication allows each group member to assess the relative strength of preferences for different options among their group mates here we investigate collective decisions by free ranging african wild dog packs in botswana african wild dogs exhibit dominant directed group living and take part in stereotyped social rallies high energy greeting ceremonies that occur before collective movements not all rallies result in collective movements for reasons that are not well understood we show that the probability of rally success i e group departure is predicted by a minimum number of audible rapid nasal exhalations sneezes within the rally moreover the number of sneezes needed for the group to depart i e the quorum was reduced whenever dominant individuals initiated rallies suggesting that dominant participation increases the likelihood of a rally s success but is not a prerequisite as such the will of the group may override dominant preferences when the consensus of subordinates is sufficiently great our findings illustrate how specific behavioural mechanisms here sneezing allow for negotiation in effect voting that shapes decision making in a wild socially complex animal society
studies on the morphology and function of the skull in the boidae serpentes part ii morphology and function of the jaw apparatus in python sebae and python molurus ||||| heads of the boid snakes python sebae and python molurus were dissected and the arthrology myology and dentition studied living specimens of these species were observed and their feeding behavior analyzed by means of high and regular speed motion pictures camera speeds of up to frames per second permitted examination of the jaw movements during the striking and seizing of prey motion picture studies conducted at regular speeds provided information on cranial movements during the swallowing of prey the morphology of the head was correlated with observed movements in an attempt to analyze the functional and adaptive implications of the jaw apparatus
a lightweight biological structure with tailored stiffness the feather vane ||||| unlabelled the flying feathers of birds are keratinous appendages designed for maximum performance with a minimum weight penalty thus their design contains ingenious combinations of components that optimize lift stiffness aerodynamics and damage resistance this design involves two main parts a central shaft that prescribes stiffness and lateral vanes which allows for the capture of air within the feather vane barbs branch from the shaft and barbules branch from barbs forming a flat surface which ensures lift microhooks at the end of barbules hold barbs tightly together providing the close knit unified structure of the feather vane and enabling a repair of the structure through the reattachment of un hooked junctions both the shaft and barbs are lightweight biological structures constructed of keratin using the common motif of a solid shell and cellular interior the cellular core increases the resistance to buckling with little added weight here we analyze the detailed structure of the feather barb and for the first time explain its flexural stiffness in terms of the mechanics of asymmetric foam filled beams subjected to bending the results are correlated and validated with finite element modeling we compare the flexure of single barbs as well as arrays of barbs and find that the interlocking adherence of barbs to one another enables a more robust structure due to minimized barb rotation during deflection thus the flexure behavior of the feather vane can be tailored by the adhesive hooking between barbs creating a system that mitigates damage a simplified three dimensional physical model for this interlocking mechanism is constructed by additive manufacturing the exceptional architecture of the feather vane will motivate the design of bioinspired structures with tailored and unique properties ranging from adhesives to aerospace materials statement of significance despite its importance to bird flight literature characterizing the feather vane is extremely limited the feather vane is composed of barbs that branch from the main shaft rachis and barbules that branch from barbs in this study the flexural behavior of the feather barb and the role of barbule connections in reinforcing the feather vane are quantitatively investigated for the first time both experimentally and theoretically through the performed experiments structure function relationships within the feather vane are uncovered additionally in the proposed model the sophisticated structure of the barbs and the interlocking mechanism of the feather vane are simplified to understand these processes in order to engineer new lightweight structures and adhesives
striking of underwater prey by a reef heron egretta gularis schistacea ||||| summarythe ability of a piscivorous bird the western reef heron egretta gularis schistacea to cope with light refraction at the air water interface was investigated the heron s capture rate of small stationary underwater prey from a variety of angles was high indicating an ability to correct for refraction two distinct phases were described during head movement i pre strike mean path angle deg to the vertical mean velocity cm s ii strike mean path angle deg mean velocity cm s when prey was unsubmerged the two phases were less distinct pre strike deg cm s strike deg cm s the point of change between phases str was assumed to be the point at which corrections for refraction were performed calculated disparities between real and apparent prey positions at str may reach cm at str highly significant correlations were found between i the heron s eye height above the water and prey depth ii the apparent prey depth and real prey depth a model is presented to explain the heron s manner of correcting for light refraction
the biomechanics of cornus canadensis stamens are ideal for catapulting pollen vertically ||||| summary rapid movements in fungi and plants have evolved in different species to facilitate the dispersal of spores and seeds the mechanisms of action can differ among species but the effectiveness of these movements has rarely if ever been tested here we show through a quantitative biomechanical analysis that the stamens of cornus canadensis l bunchberry are ideal for catapulting pollen vertically at high speeds we develop a biomechanical model to describe the explosive launch of pollen from the flowers of bunchberry the model determines the equation of motion for the stamens based only on the morphology and measurements of the parts of the stamens to measure the motion of the stamens to compare with our model we analysed individual frames of a video taken at fps the thecae of adjacent stamens dehisce in bud so that the stomia face each other retaining pollen between neighbouring anthers as the flowers open pollen is accelerated vertically as long as the thecae remain in contact pollen is released only when the anthers move horizontally and separate the observed motion of the stamens matches the results from our model through release of the pollen the model reveals that pollen release horizontal movement of the anthers occurs only after the vertical speed is at its maximum thus for this particular catapult mechanism the morphology of the stamens is optimal for launching light dry pollen straight upwards at high speed pollen launched vertically at high speed both enhances insect pollination by helping to making pollen stick on visiting insects and also allows for successful wind pollination by propelling pollen into the air column seed set by inflorescences in pollinator exclosure cages further supports the ability of this flower to use wind as a pollination mechanism
directional water collection on wetted spider silk ||||| many biological surfaces in both the plant and animal kingdom possess unusual structural features at the micro and nanometre scale that control their interaction with water and hence wettability an intriguing example is provided by desert beetles which use micrometre sized patterns of hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions on their backs to capture water from humid air as anyone who has admired spider webs adorned with dew drops will appreciate spider silk is also capable of efficiently collecting water from air here we show that the water collecting ability of the capture silk of the cribellate spider uloborus walckenaerius is the result of a unique fibre structure that forms after wetting with the wet rebuilt fibres characterized by periodic spindle knots made of random nanofibrils and separated by joints made of aligned nanofibrils these structural features result in a surface energy gradient between the spindle knots and the joints and also in a difference in laplace pressure with both factors acting together to achieve continuous condensation and directional collection of water drops around spindle knots submillimetre sized liquid drops have been driven by surface energy gradients or a difference in laplace pressure but until now neither force on its own has been used to overcome the larger hysteresis effects that make the movement of micrometre sized drops more difficult by tapping into both driving forces spider silk achieves this task inspired by this finding we designed artificial fibres that mimic the structural features of silk and exhibit its directional water collecting ability
cryptochrome and phytochrome b control shade avoidance responses in arabidopsis via partially independent hormonal cascades ||||| plants respond to a reduction in the red far red ratio r fr of light caused by the proximity of other plants by initiating morphological changes that improve light capture in arabidopsis this response shade avoidance syndrome sas is controlled by phytochromes particularly phyb and is dependent on the taa pathway of auxin biosynthesis however when grown in real canopies we found that phyb mutants and mutants deficient in taai sav still display robust sas responses to increased planting density and leaf shading the sas morphology leaf hyponasty and reduced lamina petiole ratio could be phenocopied by exposing plants to blue light attenuation these responses to blue light attenuation required the uv a blue light photoreceptor cry moreover they were mediated through mechanisms that showed only limited overlap with the pathways recruited by phyb inactivation in particular pathways for polar auxin transport auxin biosynthesis and gibberellin signaling that are involved in sas responses to low r fr were not required for the sas responses to blue light depletion by contrast the brassinosteroid response appeared to be required for the full expression of the sas phenotype under low blue light the phyb and cry inactivation pathways appeared to converge in their requirement for the basic helix loop helix bhlh transcription factors phytochrome interacting factors and pif and pif to elicit the sas phenotype our results suggest that blue light is an important control of sas responses and that pif and pif are critical hubs for a diverse array of signaling routes that control plant architecture in canopies
variation in annual and lifetime reproductive success of lance tailed manakins alpha experience mitigates effects of senescence on siring success ||||| the causes of variation in individual reproductive success over a lifetime are not well understood in long lived vertebrates reproductive output usually increases during early adulthood but it is difficult to disentangle the roles of development and learning on this gain of reproductive success lekking lance tailed manakins provide an opportunity to separate these processes as the vast majority of male reproduction occurs after a bird obtains alpha status and maintains a display area in the lek but the age at which males achieve alpha status varies widely using years of longitudinal data on age social status and genetic siring success i assessed the factors influencing variation in siring success by individuals over their lifetimes the data show increases in annual reproductive success with both age and alpha experience at advanced ages these gains were offset by senescence in fecundity individual ontogeny rather than compositional change of the population generated a nonlinear relationship of breeding tenure with lifetime success age of assuming alpha status was unrelated to tenure as a breeder or success in the alpha role importantly these findings suggest that social experience can mitigate the negative effects of senescence in older breeders
strength at the extracellular matrix muscle interface ||||| mechanical force is generated within skeletal muscle cells by contraction of specialized myofibrillar proteins this paper explores how the contractile force generated at the sarcomeres within an individual muscle fiber is transferred through the connective tissue to move the bones the initial key point for transfer of the contractile force is the muscle cell membrane sarcolemma where force is transferred laterally to the basement membrane specialized extracellular matrix rich in laminins to be integrated within the connective tissue rich in collagens before transmission to the tendons connections between key molecules outside the myofiber in the basement membrane to molecules within the sarcolemma of the myofiber and the internal cytoplasmic structures of the cytoskeleton and sarcomeres are evaluated disturbances to many components of this complex interactive system adversely affect skeletal muscle strength and integrity and can result in severe muscle diseases the mechanical aspects of these crucial linkages are discussed with particular reference to defects in laminin a and integrin a novel interventions to potentially increase muscle strength and reduce myofiber damage are mentioned and these are also highly relevant to muscle diseases and aging muscle
hygromorphs from pine cones to biomimetic bilayers ||||| we consider natural and artificial hygromorphs objects that respond to environmental humidity by changing their shape using the pine cone as an example that opens when dried and closes when wet we quantify the geometry mechanics and dynamics of closure and opening at the cell tissue and organ levels building on our prior structural knowledge a simple scaling theory allows us to quantify the hysteretic dynamics of opening and closing we also show how simple bilayer hygromorphs of paper and polymer show similar behaviour that can be quantified via a theory which couples fluid transport in a porous medium and evaporative flux to mechanics and geometry our work unifies varied observations of natural hygromorphs and suggests interesting biomimetic analogues which we illustrate using an artificial flower with a controllable blooming and closing response
hemozoin oil versus water ||||| because the quinolines inhibit heme crystallization within the malaria parasite much work has focused on mechanism of formation and inhibition of hemozoin here we review the recent evidence for heme crystallization within lipids in diverse parasites and the new implications of a lipid site of crystallization for drug targeting within leukocytes hemozoin can generate toxic radical lipid metabolites which may alter immune function or reduce deformability of uninfected erythrocytes
overcoming the brittleness of glass through bio inspiration and micro architecture ||||| highly mineralized natural materials such as teeth or mollusk shells boast unusual combinations of stiffness strength and toughness currently unmatched by engineering materials while high mineral contents provide stiffness and hardness these materials also contain weaker interfaces with intricate architectures which can channel propagating cracks into toughening configurations here we report the implementation of these features into glass using a laser engraving technique three dimensional arrays of laser generated microcracks can deflect and guide larger incoming cracks following the concept of stamp holes jigsaw like interfaces infiltrated with polyurethane furthermore channel cracks into interlocking configurations and pullout mechanisms significantly enhancing energy dissipation and toughness compared with standard glass which has no microstructure and is brittle our bio inspired glass displays built in mechanisms that make it more deformable and times tougher this bio inspired approach based on carefully architectured interfaces provides a new pathway to toughening glasses ceramics or other hard and brittle materials
understanding stress concentration about a nutrient foramen ||||| we investigated the microstructural basis of a reduced stress concentration around the primary nutrient foramen of the equine third metacarpus we quantified the spatial variations of compositional parameters mineral content volume fraction histological architecture and osteonal trajectories from microradiographs and polarizing microscopic images of thin sections these variations in composition and organization in turn cause variations in mechanical properties of cortical bone we modeled the spatially inhomogeneous anisotropic elastic properties based on the measured compositional parameters and used the properties as inputs to a finite element model of the bone containing the foramen this model spatially constructed solely from the microscopic images was subsequently validated by our mechanical test results we found that a primary mechanism for stress concentration reduction appears to be due to an increased compliance near the foramen the sharp discontinuity represented by the hole is softened by embedding it in a compliant region a reinforcing ring of increased stiffness exists at some distance from the foramen and a ring of lamellar bone exists along the foramen inside edge which might serve to reduce the chance of cracks forming there our work is allowing us to design biomimetic structures with holes by mimicking the microstructure near the nutrient foramen
surface temperatures of cacti influences of environmental and morphological factors ||||| an energy budget model predicted the average stem surface temperatures of a mam millaria dioica cm tail and a carnegiea gigantea m tail within c of the hourly measured temperatures over h periods for the ranges of various environmental factors considered in a sensitivity analysis the average surface temperature of the stem was most influenced by air temper ature greater diurnal extremes of stem temperature occurred at lower wind velocities asymmetrical heating of the stem by direct solar irradiation was clearly evident in the measurements and the simulations the model was used to study the effect of changes in spine coverage apical pubescence stem absorptance tissue thermal properties plant height and diameter on stem surface temperatures in the absence of spines the average surface temperature of mammillaria became to c cooler at night and to c warmer during the day the effect of spines on the simulated diurnal temperature variation was even greater for the apical meristem which had the most dense coverage of spines a mat of pubescence additionally protected the apical meristem of carnegiea and ferocactus acan thodes substantially reducing diurnal temperature extremes there simulated decreases in the di ameter of carnegiea increased the daily range of temperatures of the apical meristem suggesting that some adaptive optimization of plant diameter may have occurred simulations for the species under the same environmental conditions showed that the lowest stem and apical temperatures occurred for carnegiea consistent with its restriction to lower presumably warmer elevations than ferocactus and mammillaria
rain harvesting in the lizard phrynosoma cornutum behavior and integumental morphology ||||| during rainstorms texas horned lizards in enclosures were observed to exhibit a stereotyped behavior termed rain harvesting the behavior involves raising the abdomen in an arch splaying and extending the legs dorso ventral flattening and lateral spreading of the body lowering the head and tail opening and closing the jaws and drinking water collected on the dorsal body surface ingestion of integumentally derived water was verified by recovery of dyed water from the gut sem stereophotographs illustrate the interscalar channels through which water is carried apparently by cap illary action over body surfaces to the jaws during light rainfall water flow to the jaws occurs within interscalar channels but during heavy rainfall gravitational sheet flow may increase the amount of water arriving at the jaws this integumental rain harvesting system is similar to reported interscalar water transport in two agamid lizards moloch horridus and phrynocephalus helioscopus apparently phry nosoma and p helioscopus have similar behaviors for rain harvesting this is the first report to provide observations of a lizard obtaining water from natural precipitation for drinking by integumental inter ception and transport
self burial behaviour of erodium cicutarium seeds ||||| the self planting mechanism of the hygroscopic seeds of erodium cicutarium was examined burial depended first on the location of crevices by the seeds the seeds were more likely to establish themselves in large crevices even when their awn tails awn hairs and carpel tips had been removed experimentally once in a crevice the probability of a seed remaining there and the depth attained were greater when the crevices were small in small crevices seeds with intact awns and carpels attained greater depths than that of those without these structures when crevices were small and common the seeds became established after five uncoiling recoiling cycles in large crevices eight cycles were required for establishment when crevices were small and infrequent forty cycles were required
an overview on plant cuticle biomechanics ||||| plant biomechanics combines the principles of physics chemistry and engineering to answer questions about plant growth development and interaction with the environment the epidermal growth control theory postulated in and verified in states that epidermal cells determine the rate of organ elongation since they are under tension while inner tissues are under compression the lipid cuticle layer is deposited on the surface of outer epidermal cell walls and modifies the chemical and mechanical nature of these cell walls thus the plant cuticle plays a key role in plant interaction with the environment and in controlling organ expansion rheological analyses indicate that the cuticle is a mostly viscoelastic and strain hardening material that stiffens the comparatively more elastic epidermal cell walls cuticle stiffness can be attributed to polysaccharides and flavonoids present in the cuticle whereas a cutin matrix is mainly responsible for its extensibility environmental conditions such as temperature and relative humidity have a plasticizing effect on the mechanical properties of cuticle since they lower cuticle stiffness and strength the external appearance of agricultural commodities especially fruits is of great economic value mechanical properties of the cuticle can have a positive or negative effect on disorders like fruit cracking fungal pathogen penetration and pest infestation cuticle rheology has significant variability within a species and thus can be subjected to selection in order to breed cultivars resistant to pests infestation and disorders
acetogenesis and the wood ljungdahl pathway of co fixation ||||| conceptually the simplest way to synthesize an organic molecule is to construct it one carbon at a time the wood ljungdahl pathway of co fixation involves this type of stepwise process the biochemical events that underlie the condensation of two one carbon units to form the two carbon compound acetate have intrigued chemists biochemists and microbiologists for many decades we begin this review with a description of the biology of acetogenesis then we provide a short history of the important discoveries that have led to the identification of the key components and steps of this usual mechanism of co and co fixation in this historical perspective we have included reflections that hopefully will sketch the landscape of the controversies hypotheses and opinions that led to the key experiments and discoveries we then describe the properties of the genes and enzymes involved in the pathway and conclude with a section describing some major questions that remain unanswered
tendon elasticity and muscle function ||||| vertebrate animals exploit the elastic properties of their tendons in several different ways firstly metabolic energy can be saved in locomotion if tendons stretch and then recoil storing and returning elastic strain energy as the animal loses and regains kinetic energy leg tendons save energy in this way when birds and mammals run and an aponeurosis in the back is also important in galloping mammals tendons may have similar energy saving roles in other modes of locomotion for example in cetacean swimming secondly tendons can recoil elastically much faster than muscles can shorten enabling animals to jump further than they otherwise could thirdly tendon elasticity affects the control of muscles enhancing force control at the expense of position control

elastic energy stores in running vertebrates ||||| large mammals save much of the energy they would otherwise need for running by means of elastic structures in their legs kinetic and potential energy lost at one stage of a stride is stored temporarily as elastic strain energy and returned later in an elastic recoil at high speeds men and kangaroos seem to save in this way more than half the metabolic energy they would otherwise need for locomotion it is shown by means of a generalized model that muscles and tendons could both be important as elastic energy stores analysis of films and force records of kangaroos hopping shows that strain energy stored while the feet are on the ground must be stored mainly distal to the knee the principal muscles there have short fibres and most of the storage must be in tendons investigation of camels shows that tendons in the feet distal to the ankle and wrist are especially important the scope for elastic storage while the feet are off the groundis also considered though the evidence presented in this paper comes mainly from a few species the conclusions presumably apply to large mammals in general
incidence and mechanical significance of pneumatization in the long bones of birds ||||| the incidence of pneumatization in avian long bones was studied by direct observation in a large sample of species only proximal bones humerus and femur presented pneumatization in the sample studied the incidence obtained was related to the variation of the maximum cortical thickness and mechanical properties such as bending strength and flexural young s modulus cortical thickness bending strength and flexural young s modulus were significantly lower in pneumatized bones than in marrow filled bones furthermore some congruence was found between pneumatization and systematic groups when compared in this sense charadriformes was the only order studied with total absence of long bone pneumatization results on cortical thickness appear to be in agreement with modelling predictions previously made and with results obtained on other groups of flying vertebrates the possible selective advantage of reduction in cortical thickness in relation to flying is suggested
the tubercles on humpback whales flippers application of bio inspired technology ||||| the humpback whale megaptera novaeangliae is exceptional among the large baleen whales in its ability to undertake aquabatic maneuvers to catch prey humpback whales utilize extremely mobile wing like flippers for banking and turning large rounded tubercles along the leading edge of the flipper are morphological structures that are unique in nature the tubercles on the leading edge act as passive flow control devices that improve performance and maneuverability of the flipper experimental analysis of finite wing models has demonstrated that the presence of tubercles produces a delay in the angle of attack until stall thereby increasing maximum lift and decreasing drag possible fluid dynamic mechanisms for improved performance include delay of stall through generation of a vortex and modification of the boundary layer and increase in effective span by reduction of both spanwise flow and strength of the tip vortex the tubercles provide a bio inspired design that has commercial viability for wing like structures control of passive flow has the advantages of eliminating complex costly high maintenance and heavy control mechanisms while improving performance for lifting bodies in air and water the tubercles on the leading edge can be applied to the design of watercraft aircraft ventilation fans and windmills
flow dependent porosity and other biomechanical properties of mysticete baleen ||||| summary despite its vital function in a highly dynamic environment baleen is typically assumed to be a static material its biomechanical and material properties have not previously been explored thus i tested sections of baleen from bowhead whales balaena mysticetus and humpback whales megaptera novaeangliae alone or in groups representing miniature racks in a flow tank through which water and buoyant particles circulated with variable flow velocity kinematic sequences were recorded through an endoscopic camera or viewing window one set of experiments investigated particle capture another series analyzed biomechanical behavior including fringe spacing movement and interaction baleen fringe porosity directly correlates in a mostly linear fashion with velocity of incident water flow however undulation and interaction of fringes especially of bowheads at higher flow velocities can decrease porosity fringe porosity depends on distance from the baleen plate porosity also varies with fringe length by position along the length of an individual plate plate orientation which varied from to deg relative to water flow is crucial in fringe spacing and particle capture at all flow velocities porosity is lowest with plates aligned parallel to water flow turbulence introduced when plates rotate perpendicular to flow as in cross flow filtration increases fringe interaction so that particles more easily strike fringes yet more readily dislodge baleen of bowhead whales which feed by continuous ram filtration differs biomechanically from that of humpbacks which use intermittent lunge filtration the longer finer fringes of bowhead baleen readily form a mesh like mat especially at higher flow velocities to trap tiny particles
physiological ecology of nest construction and protein flow in pre emergence colonies of polistes chinensis hymenoptera vespidae effects of rainfall and microclimates ||||| the amount of oral secretion which mostly consists of proteinaceous materials used for the construction and maintenance of nests by foundresses of polistes chinensis was analysed in field nests the amounts always exceeded of mean percent secretion to total the dry nest weights and it was greater in nests built at sites exposed to direct rainfall than in those at sheltered sites further exposed nests built in a rainy year were much smaller than those of and and the amount of secretion in that year was much greater than in the other years the nitrogen content of adult workers immatures those left inside cells and the oral secretion in nests of showed that of total protein resources brought in during the founding phase may be devoted to producing the secretion the results suggest that the foundresses may regulate the amounts of oral secretion used for such purposes in response to environmental conditions
flow flapping and photosynthesis ofnereocystis leutkeana a functional comparison of undulate and flat blade morphologies ||||| a number of species of macroalagae possess a flat strap like blade morphology in habitats exposed to rapidly moving water whereas those at protected sites have a wider undulate blade shape we have explored the functional consequences of flat narrow vs wide undulate blade morphologies in the giant bull kelpnereocystis luetkeana our study focused on the behavior of blades in ambient water currents and the consequences of that behavior to breakage and to photosynthesis in flowing water the narrow flat blades flap with lower amplitude and collapse together into a more streamlined bundle than do wide undulate blades and hence experience lower drag per blade area at a given flow velocity if the algae at current swept sites had ruffled blades drag forces would sometimes be sufficient to break the stipes however flat blades in a streamlined bundle experience more self shading than do undulate blades which remain spread out in water currents thus there is a morphological trade off between reducing drag and reducing self shading photosynthetic c hco uptake rates decrease in slow flow when the boundary layer along the blade surface across which diffusion takes place is relatively thick however blade flapping which stirs water near the blade surface enhances carbon uptake rates in slow water currents for both the undulate and the flat morphologies
the hydrodynamic function of shark skin and two biomimetic applications ||||| summary it has long been suspected that the denticles on shark skin reduce hydrodynamic drag during locomotion and a number of man made materials have been produced that purport to use shark skin like surface roughness to reduce drag during swimming but no studies to date have tested these claims of drag reduction under dynamic and controlled conditions in which the swimming speed and hydrodynamics of shark skin and skin like materials can be quantitatively compared with those of controls lacking surface ornamentation or with surfaces in different orientations we use a flapping foil robotic device that allows accurate determination of the self propelled swimming sps speed of both rigid and flexible membrane like foils made of shark skin and two biomimetic models of shark skin to measure locomotor performance we studied the sps speed of real shark skin a silicone riblet material with evenly spaced ridges and a speedo r shark skin like swimsuit fabric attached to rigid flat plate foils and when made into flexible membrane like foils we found no consistent increase in swimming speed with speedo r fabric a increase with riblet material whereas shark skin membranes but not rigid shark skin plates showed a mean increase in swimming speed compared with the same skin foils after removing the denticles deformation of the shark skin membrane is thus crucial to the drag reducing effect of surface denticles digital particle image velocimetry dpiv of the flow field surrounding moving shark skin foils shows that skin denticles promote enhanced leading edge suction which might have contributed to the observed increase in swimming speed shark skin denticles might thus enhance thrust as well as reduce drag
an intertidal sea star adjusts thermal inertia to avoid extreme body temperatures ||||| the body temperature of ectotherms is influenced by the interaction of abiotic conditions morphology and behavior although organisms living in different thermal habitats may exhibit morphological plasticity or move from unfavorable locations there are few examples of animals adjusting their thermal properties in response to short term changes in local conditions here we show that the intertidal sea star pisaster ochraceus modulates its thermal inertia in response to prior thermal exposure after exposure to high body temperature at low tide sea stars increase the amount of colder than air fluid in their coelomic cavity when submerged during high tide resulting in a lower body temperature during the subsequent low tide moreover this buffering capacity is more effective when seawater is cold during the previous high tide this ability to modify the volume of coelomic fluid provides sea stars with a novel thermoregulatory backup when faced with prolonged exposure to elevated aerial temperatures
heat exchange from the toucan bill reveals a controllable vascular thermal radiator ||||| toucan heat exchanger toucans are instantly recognizable by their large bills which in the toco toucan ramphastos toco accounts for about one third of the total body length the toucan s bill has been interpreted as a sexual ornament and as an adaptation for handling fruit tattersall et al p explore an alternative explanation in which the bill serves primarily as a thermoregulator infrared thermography techniques which allow detailed observations with minimal disturbance to the birds show that the birds alter blood flow to the bill according to ambient conditions effectively using it as a radiator to dump heat toucans alter blood flow to their massive bills according to ambient conditions the toco toucan ramphastos toco the largest member of the toucan family possesses the largest beak relative to body size of all birds this exaggerated feature has received various interpretations from serving as a sexual ornament to being a refined adaptation for feeding however it is also a significant surface area for heat exchange here we show the remarkable capacity of the toco toucan to regulate heat distribution by modifying blood flow using the bill as a transient thermal radiator our results indicate that the toucan s bill is relative to its size one of the largest thermal windows in the animal kingdom rivaling elephants ears in its ability to radiate body heat
leading edge tubercles delay stall on humpback whale megaptera novaeangliae flippers ||||| the humpback whale megaptera novaeangliae is exceptional among the baleen whales in its ability to undertake acrobatic underwater maneuvers to catch prey in order to execute these banking and turning maneuvers humpback whales utilize extremely mobile flippers the humpback whale flipper is unique because of the presence of large protuberances or tubercles located on the leading edge which gives this surface a scalloped appearance we show through wind tunnel measurements that the addition of leading edge tubercles to a scale model of an idealized humpback whale flipper delays the stall angle by approximately while increasing lift and decreasing drag
efficient atmospheric cleansing of oxidized organic trace gases by vegetation ||||| volatiles versus vegetation plants act as both global sources and sinks of highly reactive volatile organic compounds vocs models typically treat the uptake and degradation of these compounds as if they are mostly unreactive like other more commonly studied biogenic gases such as ozone a study by karl et al p published online october suggests that vocs may be more reactive than expected by monitoring six field sites representing a range of deciduous ecosystems several oxidized vocs were found to have high deposition fluxes fumigation experiments in the laboratory confirmed that leaves are capable of oxidizing these compounds and do so through an enzymatic detoxification or stress response mechanism budgets for voc flux in the atmosphere suggests that on a global scale plants may take up significant levels of vocs in polluted regions especially in the tropics deciduous trees enzymatically remove oxygenated volatile organic compounds from the atmosphere the biosphere is the major source and sink of nonmethane volatile organic compounds vocs in the atmosphere gas phase chemical reactions initiate the removal of these compounds from the atmosphere which ultimately proceeds via deposition at the surface or direct oxidation to carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide we performed ecosystem scale flux measurements that show that the removal of oxygenated voc via dry deposition is substantially larger than is currently assumed for deciduous ecosystems laboratory experiments indicate efficient enzymatic conversion and potential up regulation of various stress related genes leading to enhanced uptake rates as a response to ozone and methyl vinyl ketone exposure or mechanical wounding a revised scheme for the uptake of oxygenated vocs incorporated into a global chemistry transport model predicts appreciable regional changes in annual dry deposition fluxes
male eufriesia purpurata a ddt collecting euglossine bee in brazil ||||| while studying the ecology of the malaria vector anopheles nyssorhynchus darlingi root along the ituxi river amazonas brazil we observed aggregates of bees on the walls of houses that were routinely sprayed with ddt several bees collected from ddt treated house walls in august were identified as male specimens of eufriesia purpurata moscary of the tribe euglossini hymenoptera apoidae the bees were identified as euplusia purpurata by anthony raw laboratorio de ecologia universidade de brasilia the change of generic name from euplusia to eufriesia is based on ref these bees were well known to the local residents as the insects that eat ddt and we present here the first documentation that they are attracted to ddt actively collect large quantities of ddt from treated house walls and suffer no apparent insecticidal effects we also found that the frequency of house visiting is most intense during july to september most bees arrive at houses before h remain h and return on subsequent days to collect more ddt noise produced by bees as they collected ddt was a notable disturbance to of families interviewed along the ituxi river
aspilia spp leaves a puzzle in the feeding behavior of wild chimpanzees ||||| unlike other chimpanzee food items the leaves ofaspilia pluriseta a rudis and a mossambicensis compositae are eaten without being chewed moreover a pluriseta anda rudis are eaten slowly and singly and particularly in the early morning this unusual behavior suggests thataspilia leaves offer peculiar stimuli perhaps with pharmacological effects
effect of natural root grafting on growth response of jack pine pinus banksiana pinaceae ||||| premise of study trees are traditionally considered as distinct entities even though they can share a communal root system through root grafts which are morphological unions between two or more roots little is known regarding the ecological significance of natural root grafting but because grafted trees can share resources and secondary compounds growth of linked trees can be affected directly by the presence of root grafts traditional forest ecology concepts may have to be revised to include direct interactions between connected trees methods we hydraulically excavated six m plots three natural stands and three plantations we measured yearly radial growth and determined the influence of root grafting on radial growth of grafted trees key results during periods of root graft formation root grafting tended to reduce radial growth of jack pine trees after which growth generally increased the influence of root grafting on growth was more significant in natural stands where root grafting was more frequent than in plantations conclusions these results suggest that root grafting initially is an energetically costly process but that it is afterward nonprejudicial and maybe beneficial to tree growth the use of a communal root system allows for a maximum use of resources by redistributing them among trees leading to increased tree growth
ants recognize foes and not friends ||||| discriminating among individuals and rejecting non group members is essential for the evolution and stability of animal societies ants are good models for studying recognition mechanisms because they are typically very efficient in discriminating friends nest mates from foes non nest mates recognition in ants involves multicomponent cues encoded in cuticular hydrocarbon profiles here we tested whether workers of the carpenter ant camponotus herculeanus use the presence and or absence of cuticular hydrocarbons to discriminate between nest mates and non nest mates we supplemented the cuticular profile with synthetic hydrocarbons mixed to liquid food and then assessed behavioural responses using two different bioassays our results show that i the presence but not the absence of an additional hydrocarbon elicited aggression and that ii among the three classes of hydrocarbons tested unbranched mono methylated and dimethylated alkanes for mono methylated alkanes we present a new synthetic pathway only the dimethylated alkane was effective in eliciting aggression our results suggest that carpenter ants use a fundamentally different mechanism for nest mate recognition than previously thought they do not specifically recognize nest mates but rather recognize and reject non nest mates bearing odour cues that are novel to their own colony cuticular hydrocarbon profile this begs for a reappraisal of the mechanisms underlying recognition systems in social insects
defensive and chemical characterization of the froth produced by the cercopid aphrophora cribrata ||||| nymphs of the cercopid aphrophora cribrata cover themselves with a frothy exudate while ingesting sap from their preferred host plant the eastern white pine pinus strobus chemical analyses of froth collected from a cribrata nymphs revealed an array of metabolites belonging to five chemical classes including fatty acid derived alcohols g lactones and a single monoacylglycerol as well as the polyol pinitol and the polyhydroxyalkanoate poly hydroxybutyrate bioassays showed the natural a cribata froth as well as a synthetic mixture comprised of representative compound classes identified therein to be repellent to ants but largely devoid of topical irritancy in tests with cockroaches
charging the batteries to heal wounds through pi k ||||| endogenous electric fields in wounds have been documented for centuries but they have received little attention from the scientific community a new study shows that manipulation of these electric fields affects wound healing in vivo and identifies the phosphoinositide kinase signaling pathway as a key component of cell migration in response to electric cues
superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic plant surfaces an inspiration for biomimetic materials ||||| the diversity of plant surface structures evolved over million years has led to a large variety of highly adapted functional structures the plant cuticle provides structural and chemical modifications for surface wetting ranging from superhydrophilic to superhydrophobic in this paper the structural basics of superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic plant surfaces and their biological functions are introduced wetting in plants is influenced by the sculptures of the cells and by the fine structure of the surfaces such as folding of the cuticle or by epicuticular waxes hierarchical structures in plant surfaces are shown and further types of plant surface structuring leading to superhydrophobicity and superhydrophilicity are presented the existing and potential uses of superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic surfaces for self cleaning drag reduction during moving in water capillary liquid transport and other biomimetic materials are shown

interactions of woody and herbaceous vegetation in a southern african savanna ||||| a number of plots were set up in two natural savanna communities with identical climates but different soils to examine possible competition between the woody and herbaceous components of the vegetation the community on the more sandy soil is a broad leaf woody savanna and the other a more open microphyllous acacia community vegetative growth and soil water were monitored over a year period in control plots and in plots cleared of one of the vegetation components in the broad leaf community the effect of the herbaceous vegetation on the woody plants is negligible in the acacia community with seven times more herbaceous biomass mature woody plant growth was reduced by competition from the grass dominated herb layer particularly in the first wetter year the vertical root distributions and soil water data indicate that the grasses take up topsoil cm water sufficiently rapidly to reduce drainage into the subsoil cm and that they also take up subsoil water directly thus lowering the amount of subsoil water available to woody plants the different herbaceous to woody plant biomass ratios in the two sites and the different intensity of competition during the years can be explained in terms of the effects of the soil properties and of the rainfall intensity on the ratio of water in the topsoil to that in the subsoil
iridescence impairs object recognition in bumblebees ||||| iridescence is a taxonomically widespread and striking form of animal coloration yet despite advances in understanding its mechanism its function and adaptive value are poorly understood we test a counterintuitive hypothesis about the function of iridescence that it can act as camouflage through interference with object recognition using an established insect visual model bombus terrestris we demonstrate that both diffraction grating and multilayer iridescence impair shape recognition although not the more subtle form of diffraction grating seen in some flowers supporting the idea that both strategies can be effective means of camouflage we conclude that iridescence produces visual signals that can confuse potential predators and this might explain the high frequency of iridescence in many animal taxa
how strong is intracanopy leaf plasticity in temperate deciduous trees ||||| intracanopy plasticity in tree leaf form is a major determinant of whole plant function and potentially of forest understory ecology however there exists little systematic information for the full extent of intracanopy plasticity whether it is linked with height and exposure or its variation across species for arboretum grown trees of six temperate deciduous species averaging m in height we quantified intracanopy plasticity for leaf traits across three canopy locations basal interior basal exterior and top plasticity was pronounced across the canopy and maximum likelihood analyses indicated that plasticity was primarily linked with irradiance regardless of height intracanopy plasticity the quotient of values for top and basal interior leaves was often similar across species and statistically indistinguishable across species for several key traits at canopy tops the area of individual leaves was on average times that at basal interior stomatal density times higher sapwood cross sectional area up to times higher and leaf mass per area times higher guard cell and stomatal pore lengths were invariant across the canopy species differed in intracanopy plasticity for the mass of individual leaves leaf margin dissection ratio of leaf to sapwood areas and stomatal pore area per leaf area plasticity quotients ranged only up to across the six species trait plasticities were uncorrelated and independent of the magnitude of the canopy gradient in irradiance or height and of the species light requirements for regeneration this convergence across species indicates general optimization or constraints in development resulting in a bounded plasticity that improves canopy performance
the cyanophage molecular mixing bowl of photosynthesis genes ||||| among the wealth of microbial organisms inhabiting marine environments cyanobacteria blue green algae are the most abundant photosynthetic cells prochlorococcus and synechococcus the two most common cyanobacteria account for of global carbon fixation through the photosynthetic process in which sugars are manufactured from carbon dioxide and water by drawing on natural resources these microbes use photosystems ps i and ii the two reaction centers in photosynthesis to harness energy intriguingly some viruses that infect cyanobacteria called cyanophage carry genes that encode two psii core reaction center proteins psba the most rapidly turned over core protein in all oxygen yielding photosynthetic organisms and psbd which forms a complex with psba by expressing their own copies of psba and psbd during infection these cyanophages have managed to co opt host genes to suit their own purposes enhancing photosynthesis it seems likely that they do this in the interests of their own fitness since cyanophage production is optimal when photosynthesis is maintained during infection until recently only a small sample of cyanophages had been examined leaving open the questions of how widespread psii genes are in these organisms and where the genes came from to answer these questions matthew sullivan debbie lindell sallie chisholm and colleagues examined a pool of cyanophage isolates cultured from samples collected from the sargasso sea and the red sea along with data already available for nine other cyanophages for the presence of psba and psbd genes they found psba was present in and psbd in of the cyanophages studied by analyzing the sequences of these genes along with those from prochlorococcus and synechococcus host genes they reconstructed the evolutionary history of how the psii genes entered the phage genomes cyanophages are divided morphologically into three main families podoviridae myoviridae and siphoviridae looking at the distributions of the psii genes across the different families sullivan lindell et al saw that psba was present in all myoviruses and all prochlorococcus podoviruses but not in prochlorococcus siphoviruses or synechococcus podoviruses the high levels of sequence conservation between the different cyanophages suggest that this gene is probably functional and that it is likely to increase the reproductive fitness of the phage the length of the latent period may impact the distribution pattern of psba among these phage groups however more information about the physiological characteristics of cyanophages is needed to further investigate these possibilities the second gene psbd was less prolific but was seen in four of the prochlorococcus myoviruses and of the synechococcus myoviruses examined all of which also encoded psba myoviruses are known to infect a wider range of cyanobacteria than the other cyanophage families indeed when investigated the psbd encoding myoviruses correlated with those known to have a broader host range perhaps the co opting of both psii genes ensures a functional psba psbd protein complex to enhance infection for these cyanophages that are able to infect a wider range of hosts to determine when the psii genes had been transferred into the phage and from where sullivan lindell et al investigated the nucleotide sequences of psba and psbd from both prochlorococcus and synechococcus host and cyanophage using meticulous sequence analyses and standard statistical methods they generated phylogenetic trees to explain the evolutionary history of these two psii genes by analyzing the clusters of sequence types within the resulting tree the authors saw evidence that psba was transferred from the cyanobacteria host genome into the phage genome on four independent occasions and two separate occasions for psbd exchange events were generally host range specific meaning that prochlorococcus genes transferred to prochlorococcus phages and so on however a few intriguing exceptions where genes did not cluster with their hosts were observed these might result from genetic exchange between members of two different phage families one of broader host range during co infection of the same host sullivan lindell et al were also able to use their dataset to investigate a previous suggestion that alterations in the nucleotide distributions within individual psii genes creating a kind of patchwork gene demonstrate that intragenic recombination has taken place indeed they confirm that this occurs among synechococcus myoviruses and prochlorococcus podoviruses in some cases involving synechococcus intragenic recombination appears to have happened in both host to phage and phage to host directions for both genes and for some prochlorococcus genes dna from an unknown source also seems to have been inserted occasionally intragenic exchanges are also seen between synechococcus hosts the authors compare their cultured results to those from wild phage sequences from the pacific ocean and see that much of the natural diversity is similar to the sequences from the cyanophage isolates despite their origination from different ocean basins overall therefore a considerable amount of genetic shuffling takes place within these two psii genes in cyanophages and this creates a reservoir of photosynthetic diversity from which both host and phage are likely to benefit this study offers a compelling example of global scale microbial and phage co evolution that likely influences the biological success of these prolific marine organisms
circumferential spicule growth by pericellular silica deposition in the hexactinellid sponge monorhaphis chuni ||||| summary the giant basal spicule of the hexactinellid sponge monorhaphis chuni represents the longest natural siliceous structure on earth this spicule is composed of concentrically arranged lamellae that are approximately mm thick in the present study we investigated the formation of outer lamellae on a cellular level using microscopic and spectroscopic techniques it is shown that the formation of an outermost lamella begins with the association of cell clusters with the surface of the thickening and or growing spicule the cells release silica for controlled formation of a lamella the pericellular silica material fuses to a delimited and textured layer of silica with depressions approximately mm in diameter the newly formed layer initially displays mm wide well structured banded ribbons and only attains its plain surface in a final step the chemical composition in the depressions was studied using energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy and by staining with texas red the data suggest that those depressions are the nests for the silica forming cells and that silica formation starts with a direct association of silica forming cells with the outer surface of the spicule where they remain and initiate the development of the next lamellae
antipredator mechanisms of australian frogs ||||| we examined the antipredator mechanisms of australian hylid species two genera and myobatrachid species nine genera frogs of of the species exhibited one or more defensive mech anisms other than escape including postures bright coloration adhesive skin secretions and or calls de fensive posturing occurred in individuals of species and varied in relationship to morphology and lo calization of skin glands bright colors when present typically were displayed during defensive postures we documented dramatic geographic variation in the antipredator display of one species limnodynastes tasmaniensis defensive postures were accompanied by secretions from dorsal skin glands these secretions were sometimes associated with a distinctive odor adhesive skin secretions were present in burrowing frogs of three genera defensive calls were emitted by most hylids but none of the myobatrachids we offer a hypothesis of mimicry to explain the behavior pattern of exposing the bold black and white ventral surface in pseudophryne and crinia species
actuation systems in plants as prototypes for bioinspired devices ||||| plants have evolved a multitude of mechanisms to actuate organ movement the osmotic influx and efflux of water in living cells can cause a rapid movement of organs in a predetermined direction even dead tissue can be actuated by a swelling or drying of the plant cell walls the deformation of the organ is controlled at different levels of tissue hierarchy by geometrical constraints at the micrometre level e g cell shape and size and cell wall polymer composition at the nanoscale e g cellulose fibril orientation this paper reviews different mechanisms of organ movement in plants and highlights recent research in the field particular attention is paid to systems that are activated without any metabolism the design principles of such systems may be particularly useful for a biomimetic translation into active technical composites and moving devices

pheromone reception ||||| insects are analytical chemists par excellence they perceive the world through semiochemicals with inordinate sensitivity a male moth for example can detect a scent of woman i e a female produced sex pheromone even when the signal to noise ratio is very low in a sense the antennae are signal translators the chemicals signals are translated into the language of the brain nerve impulses or spikes by an array of sensilla mainly located on the antennae this information is conveyed to the brain for further processing chemical ecologists utilize insect antennae as biosensors for the identification of pheromones and other semiochemicals the insect olfactory system is also highly selective able to discriminate natural pheromones from molecules with minimal structural changes in some cases one stereoisomer functions as an attractant sex pheromone and its antipode is a behavioral antagonist inhibitory signal the specificity of the olfactory system seems to be achieved by two layers of filters the first level of discrimination is determined by odorantbinding proteins obps that assist the hydrophobic pheromones to cross an aqueous barrier and reach their receptors both obp and odorant receptor or contribute to the specificity of the cell response and lead to the remarkable selectivity of the insect olfactory system the members of the obp gene family encoding the encapsulins form a large group with olfactory and non olfactory proteins while the functions of many members of the family are yet to be determined there is solid evidence for the mode of action of obps pheromones and other semiochemicals enter the sensillar lymph through pore tubules in the cuticle sensillar wall are solubilized upon being encapsulated by odorant binding proteins and transported to the olfactory receptors bound pheromone molecules are protected topics in current chemistry doi b c springer verlag berlin heidelberg from odorant degrading enzymes upon interaction with negatively charged sites at the dendritic membrane the obp ligand complex undergoes a conformational change that leads to the ejection of pheromone direct activation of odorant receptors by odorant molecules initiates a cascade of events leading to the generation of spikes reverse chemical ecology is a new concept for the screening of attractants based on the binding ability of obps to test
archerfish actively control the hydrodynamics of their jets ||||| among tool using animals none are known to adaptively change the hydrodynamic properties of a free jet of water a task considered difficult in human technology hunting archerfish can strike their targets with precisely aimed water jets e g but they are also presently thought to be unable to actively control the hydrodynamics of their jets by using specifically trained fish we were able to monitor several aspects of jet production and propagation as the fish fired at targets over a much wider range of distances than previously explored we show that jets that have to travel farther also live longer furthermore the time needed until water assembles at the jet tip is not fixed rather it is adjusted so that maximum focusing occurs just before impact surprisingly the fish achieve this by modulating the dynamics of changes in the cross section of their mouth opening a mechanism that seems to not have been applied yet in human built nozzles the timing adjustments archerfish make in order to powerfully hit targets over an extended range strikingly parallel the situation in the uniquely human ability of powerful throwing based on the key role throwing played in human encephalization and cognitive evolution skillfully throwing water should similarly have led to the correlated rapid evolution of cognitive skills in this animal
a functional interpretation of cilia and mucocyte distributions on the abfrontal surface of bivalve gills ||||| abstract the lack of fundamental data on the abfrontal surface of bivalve gills has prompted a comparative study of cilia and mucocytes on this surface using scanning electron microscopy and histology on eight species of bivalves representing seven families and the four major gill types mytilus edulis modiolus modiolus arca zebra placopecten magellanicus crassostrea virginica spisula solidissima mercenaria mercenaria and mya arenaria abfrontal cilia and mucocytes were found in all species studied with types and densities differing within and between gill types the three species of homorhabdic filibranchs presented different densities of abfrontal cilia and mucocytes from very dense in m edulis to sparse in a zebra the heterorhabdic gills had intermediate cilia and mucocyte densities with highest concentrations of both abfrontal cilia and mucocytes on the principal filaments the eulamellibranchs showed low ciliary densities together with high mucocyte densities especially in s solidissima where the abfrontal mucocytes were glandular these results indicate that the abfrontal surface is a vestigial mucociliary surface the abfrontal surface cannot participate in water pumping in most species due to low ciliary densities and species with high densities of abfrontal mucocytes could utilize abfrontal mucus to reduce drag especially in the highly fused gills such as those of the eulamellibranchs the differing distributions of abfrontal cilia and mucocytes may reflect different selective pressures acting on the gills within the various taxa

conservation of essential design features in coiled coil silks ||||| silks are strong protein fibers produced by a broad array of spiders and insects the vast majority of known silks are large repetitive proteins assembled into extended beta sheet structures honeybees however have found a radically different evolutionary solution to the need for a building material the fibrous proteins of honeybee silk are small approximately kda each and nonrepetitive and adopt a coiled coil structure we examined silks from the superfamilies of the aculeata hymenoptera apocrita by infrared spectroscopy and found coiled coil structure in bees apoidea and in ants vespoidea but not in parasitic wasps of the chrysidoidea we subsequently identified and sequenced the silk genes of bumblebees bulldog ants and weaver ants and compared these with honeybee silk genes each species produced orthologues of the small fibroin proteins identified in honeybee silk each fibroin contained a continuous predicted coiled coil region of around residues flanked by residue length n and c termini the cores of the coiled coils were unusually rich in alanine there was extensive sequence divergence among the bee and ant silk genes similarity between the alignable regions of bee and ant sequences consistent with constant and equivalent divergence since the bee ant split estimated to be myr despite a high background level of sequence diversity we have identified conserved design elements that we propose are essential to the assembly and function of coiled coil silks
wetting properties of the multiscaled nanostructured polymer and metallic superhydrophobic surfaces ||||| a superhydrophobic surface is produced from industrial grade polymer materials the surface comprises partly disordered triple scaled arrays of polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf globules an inherently superhydrophobic metallic surface is produced with polymer template the mathematical model based on the cassie baxter hypothesis of air trapping under a water drop is built which gives the apparent contact angle on the manifold scaled interface the presence of several scales itself is not a sufficient condition of hydrophobicity of inherently wettable surfaces the geometrical features favoring the increase of the vapor water interface fraction are necessary for this phenomenon
no mediated cytoprotection instant adaptation to oxidative stress in bacteria ||||| numerous sophisticated systems have been described that protect bacteria from increased levels of reactive oxygen species although indispensable during prolonged oxidative stress these response systems depend on newly synthesized proteins and are hence both time and energy consuming here we describe an express cytoprotective system in bacillus subtilis which depends on nitric oxide no we show that no immediately protects bacterial cells from reactive oxygen species by two independent mechanisms no transiently suppresses the enzymatic reduction of free cysteine that fuels the damaging fenton reaction in addition no directly reactivates catalase a major antioxidant enzyme that has been inhibited in vivo by endogenous cysteine our data also reveal a critical role for bacterial no synthase in adaptation to oxidative stress associated with fast metabolic changes and suggest a possible role for no in defending pathogens against immune oxidative attack

composition of extracellular polymeric substances from periphyton assemblages in the florida everglades ||||| in wetland habitats periphyton is a common component of open water areas with species assemblage determined by local water quality extracellular polymeric substances eps secreted by algae and bacteria give structure to periphyton and differences in eps chemistry affect the functional roles of these polymers the florida everglades provide a unique opportunity to study compositional differences of eps from distinctive algal assemblages that characterize areas of differing water chemistry water conservation area wca is a soft water impoundment periphyton was loosely associated with utricularia stems and amorphous in structure with a diverse desmid and diatom assemblage and varying cyanobacterial abundance extracellular polymers were abundant and were loosely cell associated sheaths and slime layers in addition to tightly cell associated capsules the eps were complex heteropolysaccharides with significant saccharide residues of glucose xylose arabinose and fucose carboxylic acids were also prominent while ester sulfates and proteins were small components structured cohesive cyanobacteria dominated periphyton was observed in wca a a minerotrophic impoundment and filaments were heavily encrusted with calcium carbonate and detrital matter eps were primarily cell associated sheaths and polymer residues were dominated by glucose xylose fucose and galactose with uronic acids also a significant component of the polymers principal components analysis revealed that periphyton community assemblage determined the monosaccharide composition of eps which ultimately determines a range of biogeochemical processes within the periphyton
functional morphology of scale hinges used to transport water convergent drinking adaptations in desert lizards moloch horridus and phrynosoma cornutum ||||| the australian thorny devil moloch horridus gray and the texas horned lizard phrynosoma cornutum harlan have the remarkable ability to rapidly move water through interscalar spaces on their skin s surface to their mouth for drinking the morphology of these scale hinges has not been studied we used histological and sem techniques to examine and compare the scale hinges of both species additional taxa in their respective lineages were examined in order to evaluate the potential that convergent evolution has occurred in the two species that transport water each scale hinge has a basally expanded and semi enclosed channel formed by the hinge joint that is interconnected with all scale hinges on the body we hypothesize that it is within this semi tubular channel system of hinge joints where the b layer keratin of the integument is very thin that water is transported hinge joint walls are covered by a complex topography of fractured surfaces that greatly expand the channel s surface area and probably enhance capillary transport of water in addition we note differing morphology of scale surfaces at the rear of the jaws of both species we hypothesize that capillary forces fill the scale hinge system and additional forces generated within the mouth by observed motions during drinking depress local water pressure to pull water through the channels of the hinge joint system we conclude that the combined features in the two species semi tubular hinge joint channels with convoluted walls and a jaw buccal cavity pumping mechanism have convergently evolved for capture transport and drinking of water from sporadic rainfall
individually recognizable scent marks on flowers made by a solitary bee ||||| the marking of flowers with ephemeral scent is an underappreciated but vital element in the foraging behaviour of social bees using observational and experimental data we tested whether a solitary bee female anthophora plumipes uses scent marking while foraging on flowers of cerinthe major in portugal females used scent marks with at least two components that differed in their volatility and furthermore recognized the marks of different individuals a very short term component min was attractive resulting in the observed high level of immediate revisits this component appeared to be adjusted according to the foraging needs of the moment a longer term component min was initially repellent and matched the rate of nectar renewal it or the response to it also appeared to be adjusted to the perceived level of nectar reward there may be even longer term effects associated with the specific foraging areas of individual bees observed differences in the way in which individuals responded to scent marks indicate that they may play a role as part of a dominance or exclusion mechanism among females copyright the association for the study of animal behaviour
bioprospecting finds the toughest biological material extraordinary silk from a giant riverine orb spider ||||| background combining high strength and elasticity spider silks are exceptionally tough i e able to absorb massive kinetic energy before breaking spider silk is therefore a model polymer for development of high performance biomimetic fibers there are over described species of spiders most spinning multiple types of silk thus we have available some unique silks that may cover an amazing breadth of material properties to date however silks from only a few tens of species have been characterized most chosen haphazardly as model organisms nephila or simply from researchers backyards are we limited to blindly fishing in efforts to discover extraordinary silks or could scientists use ecology to predict which species are likely to spin silks exhibiting exceptional performance properties methodology we examined the biomechanical properties of silk produced by the remarkable malagasy darwin s bark spider caerostris darwini which we predicted would produce exceptional silk based upon its amazing web the spider constructs its giant orb web up to m suspended above streams rivers and lakes it attaches the web to substrates on each riverbank by anchor threads as long as meters dragline silk from both caerostris webs and forcibly pulled silk exhibits an extraordinary combination of high tensile strength and elasticity previously unknown for spider silk the toughness of forcibly silked fibers averages mj m with some samples reaching mj m thus c darwini silk is more than twice tougher than any previously described silk and over times better than kevlar r caerostris capture spiral silk is similarly exceptionally tough conclusions caerostris darwini produces the toughest known biomaterial we hypothesize that this extraordinary toughness coevolved with the unusual ecology and web architecture of these spiders decreasing the likelihood of bridgelines breaking and collapsing the web into the river this hypothesis predicts that rapid change in material properties of silk co occurred with ecological shifts within the genus and can thus be tested by combining material science behavioral observations and phylogenetics our findings highlight the potential benefits of natural history informed bioprospecting to discover silks as well as other materials with novel and exceptional properties to serve as models in biomimicry
deep supercooling vitrification and limited survival to degc in the alaskan beetle cucujus clavipes puniceus coleoptera cucujidae larvae ||||| summary larvae of the freeze avoiding beetle cucujus clavipes puniceus coleoptera cucujidae in alaska have mean supercooling points in winter of to degc with the lowest supercooling point recorded for an individual of degc we previously noted that some larvae did not freeze when cooled to degc and we speculated that these larvae vitrified here we present evidence through differential scanning calorimetry that c c puniceus larvae transition into a glass like state at temperatures degc and can avoid freezing to at least degc this novel finding adds vitrification to the list of insect overwintering strategies while overwintering beneath the bark of fallen trees c c puniceus larvae may experience low ambient temperatures of around degc and lower when microhabitat is un insulated because of low snow cover decreasing temperatures in winter are correlated with loss of body water from summer high levels near to winter lows near mg mg dry mass and concomitant increases in glycerol concentrations mol l and thermal hysteresis finally we provide direct evidence that cucujus from wiseman alaska survive temperatures to degc
collective decision making and social interaction rules in mixed species flocks of songbirds ||||| associations in mixed species foraging groups are common in animals yet have rarely been explored in the context of collective behaviour despite many investigations into the social and ecological conditions under which individuals should form groups we still know little about the specific behavioural rules that individuals adopt in these contexts or whether these can be generalized to heterospecifics here we studied collective behaviour in flocks in a community of five species of woodland passerine birds we adopted an automated data collection protocol involving visits by rfid tagged birds to feeding stations equipped with antennae over two winters recording feeding events by individuals we demonstrated highly synchronized feeding behaviour within patches with birds moving towards areas of the patch with the largest proportion of the flock using a model of collective decision making we then explored the underlying decision rule birds may be using when foraging in mixed species flocks the model tested whether birds used a different decision rule for conspecifics and heterospecifics and whether the rules used by individuals of different species varied we found that species differed in their response to the distribution of conspecifics and heterospecifics across foraging patches however simulating decisions using the different rules which reproduced our data well suggested that the outcome of using different decision rules by each species resulted in qualitatively similar overall patterns of movement it is possible that the decision rules each species uses may be adjusted to variation in mean species abundance in order for individuals to maintain the same overall flock level response this is likely to be important for maintaining coordinated behaviour across species and to result in quick and adaptive flock responses to food resources that are patchily distributed in space and time
modeling pseudomonas syringae ice nucleation protein as ab helical protein ||||| antifreeze proteins afps inhibit the growth of ice whereas ice nucleation proteins inps promote its formation although the structures of several afps are known the structure of inp has been modeled thus far because of the difficulty in determining membrane protein structures here we present a novel model of an inp structure from pseudomonas syringae based on comparison with two newly determined insect afp structures the results suggest that both this class of afps and inps may have a similar beta helical fold and that they could interact with water through the repetitive txt motif by theoretical arguments we show that the distinguishing feature between an ice inhibitor and an ice nucleator lies in the size of the ice interacting surface for inps the larger surface area acts as a template that is larger than the critical ice embryo surface area required for growth in contrast afps are small enough so that they bind to ice and inhibit further growth without acting as a nucleator
comparison of ir thermography and thermocouple measurement of heat loss from rabbit pinna ||||| the temperature of the pinnae of male new zealand white rabbits was measured by use of infrared thermography at ambient temperatures of and degrees c the average pinna temperatures were and degrees c respectively from these temperatures average heat loss from the total pinna surface area was calculated to be and w respectively preoptic temperature changes also affect the vasomotor state of the rabbit at an ambient temperature of degrees c cooling the preoptic area of the rabbit by approximately degree c resulted in an average pinna temperature of degrees c and a heat loss of w heating the preoptic area by approximately degree c resulted in an average pinna temperature of degrees c and a heat loss of w finally pinna temperatures were measured by use of a thermocouple and infrared thermography simultaneously when the pinnae were vasodilated the thermocouple measurements were consistently higher than the pinna surface temperatures measured thermographically when the pinnae were vasoconstricted the thermocouple measurements were consistently lower than the pinna surface temperatures measured thermographically the discrepancy between the two methods of measurement is discussed
a novel marine silk ||||| the discovery of a novel silk production system in a marine amphipod provides insights into the wider potential of natural silks the tube building corophioid amphipod crassicorophium bonellii produces from its legs fibrous adhesive underwater threads that combine barnacle cement biology with aspects of spider silk thread extrusion spinning we characterised the filamentous silk as a mixture of mucopolysaccharides and protein deriving from glands representing two distinct types the carbohydrate and protein silk secretion is dominated by complex b sheet structures and a high content of charged amino acid residues the filamentous secretion product exits the gland through a pore near the tip of the secretory leg after having moved through a duct which subdivides into several small ductules all terminating in a spindle shaped chamber this chamber communicates with the exterior and may be considered the silk reservoir and processing mixing space in which the silk is mechanically and potentially chemically altered and becomes fibrous we assert that further study of this probably independently evolved marine arthropod silk processing and secretion system can provide not only important insights into the more complex arachnid and insect silks but also into crustacean adhesion cements
cutaneous water acquisition by the thorny devil moloch horridus agamidae ||||| the skin of the thorny devil readily absorbs water like blotting paper the volume of water held in the cutaneous capillary system is about of the body mass water is conveyed to the mouth by the cutaneous capillary system where it is imbibed the low permeability of the skin to evaporative water loss and lack of dyed water absorption suggest that there is not any transcutaneous water absorption across the skin itself interscalar channels about m wide and an overlapping shelf around the edge of the scales that forms a sub scalar channel appear to be the primary cutaneous surface features that are responsible for the blotting paper action of the skin the capillarity force that absorbs water to the skin supports a pressure head of about cm water this capillary head is not consistent with the inter scalar capillarity channel dimension of about um but to about am one ecological role of the blotting paper skin of the thorny devil is clearly the direct uptake of rain that falls on the skin or from puddles in addition the cutaneous capillary system of the thorny devil enables water absorption
arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in alleviation of salt stress a review ||||| background salt stress has become a major threat to plant growth and productivity arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonize plant root systems and modulate plant growth in various ways scope this review addresses the significance of arbuscular mycorrhiza in alleviation of salt stress and their beneficial effects on plant growth and productivity it also focuses on recent progress in unravelling biochemical physiological and molecular mechanisms in mycorrhizal plants to alleviate salt stress conclusions the role of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in alleviating salt stress is well documented this paper reviews the mechanisms arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi employ to enhance the salt tolerance of host plants such as enhanced nutrient acquisition p n mg and ca maintenance of the k na ratio biochemical changes accumulation of proline betaines polyamines carbohydrates and antioxidants physiological changes photosynthetic efficiency relative permeability water status abscissic acid accumulation nodulation and nitrogen fixation molecular changes the expression of genes pip na h antiporters lsnced lslea and lsp cs and ultra structural changes theis review identifies certain lesser explored areas such as molecular and ultra structural changes where further research is needed for better understanding of symbiosis with reference to salt stress for optimum usage of this technology in the field on a large scale this review paper gives useful benchmark information for the development and prioritization of future research programmes
the ice worm mesenchytraeus solifugus elevates adenylate levels at low physiological temperature ||||| the ice worm mesenchytraeus solifugus is among a few metazoan species that survive exclusively in glacier ice snow in this study we demonstrate that ice worm adenylate levels i e adenosine triphosphate atp adp and amp are maintained at levels well above their mesophilic counterparts and that their response to temperature change is distinctly opposite namely ice worms increase energy levels as temperatures fall initially this response is characterized by a sharp spike in atp and the adenylate energy charge even at sub zero temperatures which is followed by corresponding increases in adp and amp within a few days these results suggest that ice worms have evolved a compensatory mechanism by which gains in adenylate nucleotides off set at least in part the inherent lethargy and death usually associated with cold temperature

prolyl hydroxylase activity in tissue homogenates of annelids from deep sea hydrothermal vents ||||| tissue homogenates of the deep sea annelids alvinella caudata and alvinella pompejana were found to contain enzyme activity resembling vertebrate prolyl hydroxylase the release of h o from h proline labeled under hydroxylated chicken protocollagen type i depended on the presence of the cofactors oxoglutarate ascorbate fe and o the release of h o could be inhibited by the prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors zinc dipyridyl dihydroxybenzoic acid and pyridine dicarboxylate as well as by the synthetic peptide pro pro gly this synthetic peptide could also serve as substrate because it enhanced the decarboxylation of oxo c glutarate alvinella prolyl hydroxylase appeared to be related to type ii vertebrate enzyme because of its lack of affinity for poly l proline and resistance to inactivation by an irreversible peptide inhibitor of chicken prolyl hydroxylase maximal enzyme activity was observed in solutions with less than oxygen saturation by contrast chicken enzyme was most active at saturating oxygen concentrations further data suggest that the alvinella enzymes are able to accept the oxo acids pyruvate oxaloacetate and oxoadipinate as substitutes of the cosubstarate oxoglutarate the data explain the high hydroxylation of alvinella collagens despite the low oxygen concentrations around hydrothermal vents
the magnetic compass of domestic chickens gallus gallus ||||| summary by directional training young domestic chickens have been shown to use a magnetic compass the same method has now been used to analyse the functional characteristics and the physical principles underlying the chickens magnetic compass tests in magnetic fields with different intensities revealed a functional window around the intensity of the local geomagnetic field with this window extending further towards lower than higher intensities testing chickens under monochromatic nm blue and nm red light suggested a wavelength dependence with orientation possible under blue but not under red light exposing chickens to an oscillating field of mhz led to disorientation identifying an underlying radical pair mechanism local anesthesia of the upper beak where iron rich structures have been described as potential magnetoreceptors did not affect the performance suggesting that these receptors are not involved in compass orientation these findings show obvious parallels to the magnetic compass described for european robins indicating that chickens and small passerines use the same type of magnetic compass mechanism this suggests that the avian magnetic compass may have evolved in the common ancestor of all present day birds to facilitate orientation within the home range
volatile fatty acids and methane production in relation to anaerobic carbohydrate fermentation in oryctes nasicornis larvae coleoptera scarabaeidae ||||| abstract physico chemical investigations into the conditions of cellulose digestion by oryctes nasicornis larvae show that the intestinal contents constitute a reducing alkaline medium the mesenteron presents facultative conditions and high ph values whereas in the proctodeum anaerobiosis is strict and the ph approaches neutrality no cellulase activity is detected either in the gut walls or the contents among the products of polysaccharide fermentation volatile fatty acids vfa and methane are identified the vfas are or times more concentrated in the mesenteron than in the proctodeal dilation and acetic acid predominates the vfas which are also present in the haemolymph must cross the intestinal barrier methane formation takes place exclusively in the proctodeal dilation from which it is released to the exterior
symbiotic nitrogen fixation in the fungus gardens of leaf cutter ants ||||| gardening for ants and termites among the social insects ants and termites are the most diverse and ecologically dominant termites are known to engage in a mutualism with nitrogen fixing bacteria and pinto tomas et al p have identified similar relationships occurring among leaf cutter ants which maintain specialized nitrogen fixing bacteria in their fungus gardens together these mutualisms are a major source of nitrogen in terrestrial ecosystems how is the evolutionary stability of such mutualistic cooperation maintained aanen et al p show that the termitomyces fungus cultured by termites remains highly related because mycelia of the same clone fuse together and grow more efficiently to out compete rare clones leaf cutting ants engage in a mutualism with nitrogen fixing bacteria that help fertilize their fungus gardens bacteria mediated acquisition of atmospheric n serves as a critical source of nitrogen in terrestrial ecosystems here we reveal that symbiotic nitrogen fixation facilitates the cultivation of specialized fungal crops by leaf cutter ants by using acetylene reduction and stable isotope experiments we demonstrated that n fixation occurred in the fungus gardens of eight leaf cutter ant species and further that this fixed nitrogen was incorporated into ant biomass symbiotic n fixing bacteria were consistently isolated from the fungus gardens of leaf cutter ant colonies collected in argentina costa rica and panama the discovery of n fixation within the leaf cutter ant microbe symbiosis reveals a previously unrecognized nitrogen source in neotropical ecosystems

ultrastructure and geographic distribution of the genus paradermamoeba gymnamoebia thecamoebidae ||||| the genus paradermamoeba includes two species with a distinct and unusually thick cell coat this coat consists of densely packed helical glycostyles up to nm in length perhaps due to the impenetrable properties of the cell coat we were unable to achieve satisfactory quality of em fixation in these species until recently in this study the treatment of cells with dilute triton x detergent prior to fixation has improved preservation of the ultrastructure of both paradermamoeba species paradermamoeba valamo has an unusual central nucleolus consisting of densely packed fibrils of nucleolar material a newly isolated strain of p levis from a uk pond priest pot forms rounded single walled cysts both species have enigmatic trichocyst like bodies in the cytoplasm despite the presence of a thick and highly differentiated cell coat dictyosomes in both species are few and are not more developed than in many other species of gymnamoebae neither ultrastructure nor lm morphology indicates the phylogenetic position of paradermamoeba it seems that the family thecamoebidae is a heterogeneous assemblage of unrelated genera recent isolation of both p valamo and p levis in switzerland and in the uk indicates the wide distribution of both species in europe
function of blue iridescence in tropical understorey plants ||||| the blue colouration seen in the leaves of selaginella willdenowii is shown to be iridescent transmission electron microscopy studies confirm the presence of a layered lamellar structure of the upper cuticle of iridescent leaves modelling of these multi layer structures suggests that they are responsible for the blue iridescence confirming the link between the observed lamellae and the recorded optical properties comparison of blue and green leaves from the same plant indicates that the loss of the blue iridescence corresponds to a loss of the multi layer structure the results reported here do not support the idea that iridescence in plants acts to enhance light capture of photosynthetically important wavelengths the reflectance of light in the range nm is very similar for both iridescent and non iridescent leaves however owing to the occurrence of blue colouration in a wide variety of shade dwelling plants it is probable that this iridescence has some adaptive benefit possible adaptive advantages of the blue iridescence in these plants are discussed
small molecules that modulate quorum sensing and control virulence in pseudomonas aeruginosa ||||| bacteria use small molecule signals to access their local population densities in a process called quorum sensing qs once a threshold signal concentration is reached and therefore a certain number of bacteria have assembled bacteria use qs to change gene expression levels and initiate behaviors that benefit the group these group processes play central roles in both bacterial virulence and symbiosis and can have significant impacts on human health agriculture and the environment the dependence of qs on small molecule signals has inspired organic chemists to design non native molecules that can intercept these signals and thereby perturb bacterial group behaviors the opportunistic pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa has been the target of many of these efforts due to its prevalence in human infections p aeruginosa uses at least two n acyl l homoserine lactone signals and three homologous luxr type receptors to initiate a range of pathogenic behaviors at high cell densities including biofilm formation and the production of an arsenal of virulence factors this perspective highlights recent chemical efforts to modulate luxr type receptor activity in p aeruginosa and offers insight into the development of receptor specific ligands as potential antivirulence strategies
characterization of the nanocomposite laminate structure occurring in fish scales from arapaima gigas ||||| in the present paper the nanocomposite laminate structure of scales from the amazonian fish arapaima gigas is investigated the structure and composition of the scales were assessed by means of x ray diffraction xrd and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir the theory of fickian diffusion is used and discussed in order to rationalize the water absorption and desorption behavior of the scales morphology studies and fracture analysis of the native scales were carried out using transmission electron microscopy tem light optical microscopy lom and scanning electron microscopy sem a fibrous layer of collagen and a plywood like structure were observed in order to study the mineral phase the native scales were burned at degc until all the organic components were degraded the remaining ashes were then observed under the microscope and weighed to determine ratio of organic and inorganic components the mechanical behavior of dry and wet scales was assessed by tensile tests and the effect of water in mechanical properties is also discussed
elastic instability model of rapid beak closure in hummingbirds ||||| the hummingbird beak specialized for feeding on floral nectars is also uniquely adapted to eating flying insects during insect capture the beak often appears to close at a rate that cannot be explained by direct muscular action alone here we show that the lower jaw of hummingbirds has a shape and compliance that allows for a controlled elastic snap furthermore hummingbirds have the musculature needed to independently bend and twist the sides of the lower jaw according to both our simple physical model and our elastic instability calculation the jaw can be smoothly opened and then snapped closed through an appropriate sequence of bending and twisting actions by the muscles of the lower jaw
fish exploiting vortices decrease muscle activity ||||| fishes moving through turbulent flows or in formation are regularly exposed to vortices although animals living in fluid environments commonly capture energy from vortices experimental data on the hydrodynamics and neural control of interactions between fish and vortices are lacking we used quantitative flow visualization and electromyography to show that trout will adopt a novel mode of locomotion to slalom in between experimentally generated vortices by activating only their anterior axial muscles reduced muscle activity during vortex exploitation compared with the activity of fishes engaged in undulatory swimming suggests a decrease in the cost of locomotion and provides a mechanism to understand the patterns of fish distributions in schools and riverine environments
intraspecific directed deterrence by the mustard oil bomb in a desert plant ||||| plant secondary metabolites sms acting as defensive chemicals in reproductive organs such as fruit tissues play roles in both mutualistic and antagonistic interactions between plants and seed dispersers predators the directed deterrence hypothesis states that sms in ripe fruits deter seed predators but have little or no effect on seed dispersers indeed studies have demonstrated that birds are able to cope with fruit sms whereas rodents are deterred by them however this mechanism was only demonstrated at the class level i e between birds and mammals based on differences in the vanilloid receptors here we present experimental and behavioral data demonstrating the use of the broad range class independent mustard oil bomb mechanism in ochradenus baccatus fruits to force a behavioral change at an ecological timescale converting rodents from seed predators to seed dispersers this is achieved by a unique compartmentalization of the mustard oil bomb causing activation of the system only upon seed and pulp coconsumption encouraging seed dispersal via seed spitting by rodents our findings demonstrate the power of sms to shift the animal plant relationship from predation to mutualism and provide support for the directed deterrence hypothesis at the intraspecific level in addition to the interspecific level
nutritional toxicology of mammals regulated intake of plant secondary compounds ||||| summary many mammalian herbivores continually face the possibility of being poisoned by the natural toxins in the plants they consume a recent key discovery in this area is that mammalian herbivores are capable of regulating the dose of plant secondary compounds pscs ingested the regulation model describes the factors driving ingestion of pscs by mammals and can be dissected into two separate hypotheses related to meal size and inter meal interval imi testing these hypotheses independently yields a more thorough understanding of the underlying and potentially interconnected mechanisms three mechanisms could influence the size of meals that contain pscs these are the plasma concentration of pscs conditioned learning and activation of bitter receptors in the intestine two mechanisms are proposed to govern the imi the first predicts that imi is dependent on the concentration of psc metabolites in the plasma feeding will not resume until metabolite concentrations are acceptable for further ingestion of pscs the second hypothesis proposes that the intestinal bitter receptors modulate imi through release of satiety compounds
extreme anoxia tolerance in embryos of the annual killifish austrofundulus limnaeus insights from a metabolomics analysis ||||| summary the annual killifish austrofundulus limnaeus survives in ephemeral pond habitats by producing drought tolerant diapausing embryos these embryos probably experience oxygen deprivation as part of their normal developmental environment we assessed the anoxia tolerance of a limnaeus embryos across the duration of embryonic development embryos develop a substantial tolerance to anoxia during early development which peaks during diapause ii this extreme tolerance of anoxia is retained during the first days of post diapause ii development and is then lost metabolism during anoxia appears to be supported mainly by production of lactate with alanine and succinate production contributing to a lesser degree anoxic embryos also accumulate large quantities of g aminobutyrate gaba a potential protector of neural function it appears that the suite of characters associated with normal development and entry into diapause ii in this species prepares the embryos for long term survival in anoxia even while the embryos are exposed to aerobic conditions this is the first report of such extreme anoxia tolerance in a vertebrate embryo and introduces a new model for the study of anoxia tolerance in vertebrates
a test of whether economy or nutrition determines fecal sac ingestion in nesting corvids ||||| parent birds of many species eat the fecal sacs produced by their nestlings two hypotheses have been proposed to explain why the parents ingest rather than simply remove the sacs the parental nutrition hypothesis proposes that the parent benefits energetically or nutritionally from ingesting the sacs morton gluck and the economic disposal hypothesis postulates that parents incur some costs from eating waste products but the cost of eating them is less than the benefits gained from being allowed to remain at the nest hurd et al behavioral data on nesting florida scrub jays aphelocoma c coerulescens and american crows corvus brachyrhynchos support the parental nutrition and not the economic disposal hypothesis in both species when two parents were present at the production of fecal sacs the most nutritionally stressed parent the female ate significantly more sacs than her mate on occasions where one adult left the nest immediately after fecal sac production and one remained the departing adult was not more likely to dispose of the sac in either species in neither species was a departing adult more likely to carry of a fecal sac than eat it
brain cooling an economy mode of temperature regulation in artiodactyls ||||| artiodactyls employ selective brain cooling sbc regularly during experimental hyperthermia in free ranging antelopes however sbc often was present when body temperature was low but absent when brain temperature was near degrees c the primary effect of sbc is to adjust the activity of the heat loss mechanisms to the magnitude of the heat stress rather than to the protection of the brain from thermal damage
rin functions with plasma membrane h atpases to regulate stomatal apertures during pathogen attack ||||| in plants the protein rin acts with the plasma membrane h atpase to regulate pathogen entry and the innate immune response in part through the regulation of stomatal closure
the mechanics of seed expulsion in acanthaceae ||||| abstract the bilocular seed capsules of species on the acanthaceae subfamily acanthoideae are either hygrochastic or xerochastic but in both cases the mechanism for seed expulsion is similar only the trigger differs in the two instances the drying of the capsule results in the storage of elastic energy in the capsule valves the failure of the seam joining the two values precipitates the conversion of the elastic potential energy stored in the valves and seeds in the hygrochastic case the failure is due to moisture absorption on wetting of the capsule beak which weakens the pectic glue in the xerochastic case the seam failure is due simply to the high stress in the bonding layer at some degree of desiccation this paper explains quantitatively how the anatomy of the capsule efficiently imports high initial expulsion velocity to the seeds in order to maximize their range the specific example considered inruellia brittonianaleonard a cultivated shrub native to mexico but the situation is similar for the entire acanthoideae subfamily
integrative biomechanics for tree ecology beyond wood density and strength ||||| functional ecology has long considered the support function as important but its biomechanical complexity is only just being elucidated we show here that it can be described on the basis of four biomechanical traits two safety traits against winds and self buckling and two motricity traits involved in sustaining an upright position tropic motion velocity mv and posture control pc all these traits are integrated at the tree scale combining tree size and shape together with wood properties the assumption of trait constancy has been used to derive allometric scaling laws but it was more recently found that observing their variations among environments and functional groups or during ontogeny provides more insights into adaptive syndromes of tree shape and wood properties however oversimplified expressions have often been used possibly concealing key adaptive drivers an extreme case of oversimplification is the use of wood basic density as a proxy for safety actually as wood density is involved in stiffness loads and construction costs the impact of its variations on safety is non trivial moreover other wood features especially the microfibril angle mfa are also involved furthermore wood is not only stiff and strong but it also acts as a motor for mv and pc the relevant wood trait for this is maturation strain asymmetry maturation strains vary with cell wall characteristics such as mfa rather than with wood density finally the need for further studies about the ecological relevance of branching patterns motricity traits and growth responses to mechanical loads is discussed
iridescent colors of hummingbird feathers ||||| the reflectance spectra of iridescent hummingbird feathers were measured spectrophotometrically for many species and the structure of the iridescent parts of such feathers investigated by electron microscopy in the direction normal to the iridescent feather surfaces the structure is found to be periodic in optical dimensions it consists of stacks of elliptical platelets of a material with refractive index each containing a structurally reinforced air gap to interpret the reflectance spectra in terms of the surface structures a theory is given of reflection coefficients of stratified media with analytic refractive index variations the theory is applied to the iridescence of hummingbird feathers and accounts quantitatively for the iridescent colors as interference colors by reflection from the observed feather structures
exopolymer alteration of physical properties of sea ice and implications for ice habitability and biogeochemistry in a warmer arctic ||||| the physical properties of arctic sea ice determine its habitability whether ice dwelling organisms can change those properties has rarely been addressed following discovery that sea ice contains an abundance of gelatinous extracellular polymeric substances eps we examined the effects of algal eps on the microstructure and salt retention of ice grown from saline solutions containing eps from a culture of the sea ice diatom melosira arctica we also experimented with xanthan gum and with eps from a culture of the cold adapted bacterium colwellia psychrerythraea strain h quantitative microscopic analyses of the artificial ice containing melosira eps revealed convoluted ice pore morphologies of high fractal dimension mimicking features found in eps rich coastal sea ice whereas eps free control ice featured much simpler pore geometries a heat sensitive glycoprotein fraction of melosira eps accounted for complex pore morphologies although all tested forms of eps increased bulk ice salinity by above the controls ice containing native melosira eps retained the most salt eps effects on ice and pore microstructure improve sea ice habitability survivability and potential for increased primary productivity even as they may alter the persistence and biogeochemical imprint of sea ice on the surface ocean in a warming climate
nitrogen fixation by symbiotic and free living spirochetes ||||| spirochetes from termite hindguts and freshwater sediments possessed homologs of a nitrogenase gene nifh and exhibited nitrogenase activity a previously unrecognized metabolic capability in spirochetes fixation of dinitrogen was demonstrated with termite gut treponema zas and free livingspirochaeta aurantia homologs of nifh were also present in human oral and bovine ruminal treponemes results implicate spirochetes in the nitrogen nutrition of termites whose food is typically low in nitrogen and in global nitrogen cycling these results also proffer spirochetes as a likely origin of certainnifhs observed in termite guts and other environments that were not previously attributable to known microbes
filtration of submicrometer particles by pelagic tunicates ||||| salps are common in oceanic waters and have higher per individual filtration rates than any other zooplankton filter feeder although salps are centimeters in length feeding via particle capture occurs on a fine mucous mesh fiber diameter d mm at low velocity u cm s mean sd and is thus a low reynolds number re process in contrast to the current view that particle encounter is dictated by simple sieving of particles larger than the mesh spacing a low re mathematical model of encounter rates by the salp feeding apparatus for realistic oceanic particle size distributions shows that submicron particles due to their higher abundances are encountered at higher rates particles per time than larger particles data from feeding experiments with and mm diameter polystyrene spheres corroborate these findings although particles larger than mm e g flagellates small diatoms represent a larger carbon pool smaller particles in the to mm range e g bacteria prochlorococcus may be more quickly digestible because they present more surface area and we find that particles smaller than the mesh size mm can fully satisfy salp energetic needs furthermore by packaging submicrometer particles into rapidly sinking fecal pellets pelagic tunicates can substantially change particle size spectra and increase downward fluxes in the ocean
earthworm bioluminescence characterization of high specific activity diplocardia longa luciferase and the reaction it catalyzes ||||| diplocardia longa luciferase purified by an improved procedure differs from that first described by bellisario et al bellisario r spencer t e cormier m j biochemistry in having much higher specific activity x and firmly bound epr silent copper improved assay conditions suggest that this protein acts as a catalyst in a bioluminescent reaction involving the degradation of isovalerylamino hydroxypropane hydroperoxide this substrate is formed spontaneously on the addition of hydrogen peroxide to d longa luciferin isovalerylamino propanal the quantum yield of the bioluminescence for this substrate is detailed physical and chemical analyses of high specific activity d longa luciferase indicate that it is a large daltons asymmetric f fo with g g hydration multisubunit enzyme it contains carbohydrate lipid and copper up to mol daltons the amino acid composition is unusual with by weight of the residues being either proline or hydroxyproline
companion planting with french marigolds protects tomato plants from glasshouse whiteflies through the emission of airborne limonene ||||| horticulturalists and gardeners in temperate regions often claim that planting marigolds next to tomato plants protects the tomatoes from the glasshouse whitefly trialeurodes vaporariorum westwood if shown to hold true this technique could be used in larger scale tomato production protecting the crop and helping to introduce greater plant diversity into these agro ecosystems here we present two large scale glasshouse trials corresponding to the two main ways growers are likely to use marigolds to control whiteflies in the first marigolds are grown next to tomato throughout the growing period and we quantify whitefly population growth from the seedling stage over a day infestation period here we show that association with marigolds significantly slows whitefly population development introducing additional whitefly attractive pull plants around the perimeter of plots has little effect but reducing the proportion of marigolds and introducing other non hosts of whiteflies basil nasturtium and chinese cabbage also reduces whitefly populations on tomato the second experiment assesses the efficacy of marigolds when used as an emergency measure here we allow whitefly populations to build to a high density on unprotected tomatoes then introduce marigolds and assess whitefly population over a further period following laboratory work showing limonene to be a major chemical component of french marigolds and a negative behaviour response of whiteflies to this compound limonene dispensers are added as an additional treatment to this experiment emergency marigold companion planting yielded minimal reductions in whitefly performance but the use of limonene dispensers was more effective our work indicates that companion planting short vine tomatoes with french marigolds throughout the growing season will slow development of whitefly populations introducing marigolds to unprotected tomatoes after significant whitefly build up will be less effective the use of limonene dispensers placed near to tomato plants also shows promise it is argued that this work supports the possibility of the development of a mixture of tomato companion plants that infer associational resistance against many major invertebrate pests of tomato such a mixture if comprising edible or ornamental plants would be economically viable would reduce the need for additional chemical and biological control and if used outdoors would generate plant diverse agro ecosystems that are better able to harbour invertebrate wildlife
common mycorrhizal networks provide a potential pathway for the transfer of hydraulically lifted water between plants ||||| plant roots may be linked by shared or common mycorrhizal networks cmns that constitute pathways for the transfer of resources among plants the potential for water transfer by such networks was examined by manipulating cmns independently of plant roots in order to isolate the role s of ectomycorrhizal em and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal amf networks in the plant water balance during drought soil water potential mpa fluorescent tracer dyes and deuterium enriched water were used to follow the pathways of water transfer from coastal live oak seedlings quercus agrifolia nee colonized by em and amf conducting hydraulic lift hl into the roots of water stressed seedlings connected only by em q agrifolia or amf networks q agrifolia eriogonum fasciculatum benth salvia mellifera greene keckiella antirrhinoides benth when connected to donor plants by hyphal linkages deuterium was detected in the transpiration flux of receiver oak plants and dye labelled extraradical hyphae rhizomorphs mantles and hartig nets were observed in receiver em oak roots and in amf hyphae of salvia hyphal labelling was scarce in eriogonum and keckiella since these species are less dependent on amf the observed patterns of dye distribution also indicated that only a small percentage of mycorrhizal roots and extraradical hyphae were involved with water transfer among plants our results suggest that the movement of water by cmns is potentially important to plant survival during drought and that the functional ecophysiological traits of individual mycorrhizal fungi may be a component of this mechanism
thermal energy exchange model and water loss of a barrel cactus ferocactus acanthodes ||||| the influences of various diurnal stomatal opening patterns spines and ribs on the stem surface temperature and water economy of a cam succulent the barrel cactus ferocactus acanthodes were examined using an energy budget model to incorporate energy exchanges by shortwave and longwave irradiation latent heat conduction and convection as well as the heat storage in the massive stem the plant was subdivided into over internal and external regions in the model this enabled the average surface temperature to be predicted within c of the measured temperature for both winter and summer days reducing the stem water vapor conductance from the values observed in the field to zero caused the average daily stem surface temperature to increase only c for a winter day and c for a summer day thus latent heat loss does not substantially reduce stem temperature although the surface temperatures averaged c warmer for the summer day than for the winter day for a plant cm tall the temperature dependence of stomatal opening caused the simulated nighttime water loss rates to be about the same for the days spines moderated the amplitude of the diurnal temperature changes of the stem surface since the daily variation was c for the winter day and c for the summer day with spines compared with c and c respectively in their simulated absence ribs reduced the daytime temperature rise by providing more area for convective heat loss than for a smooth circumscribing surface in a simulation where both spines and ribs were eliminated the daytime average surface temperature rose by c
contributions of feather microstructure to eider down insulation properties ||||| insulation is an essential component of nest structure that helps provide incubation requirements for birds many species of waterfowl breed in high latitudes where rapid heat loss can necessitate a high energetic input from parents and use down feathers to line their nests common eider somateria mollissima nest down has exceptional insulating properties but the microstructural mechanisms behind the feather properties have not been thoroughly examined here we hypothesized that insulating properties of nest down are correlated to down feather plumule microstructure we tested the thermal efficiency fill power and cohesion of plumules from nests of two icelandic colonies of wild common eiders and compared them to properties of plumules of wild greylag goose anser anser we then used electron microscopy to examine the morphological basis of feather insulating properties we found that greylag goose down has higher fill power i e traps more air but much lower cohesion i e less prone to stick together compared to common eider down these differences were related to interspecific variation in feather microstructure down cohesion increased with the number of barbule microstructures prongs that create strong points of contact among feathers eider down feathers also had longer barbules than greylag goose down feathers likely increasing their air trapping capacity feather properties of these two species might reflect the demands of their contrasting evolutionary history in greylag goose a temperate terrestrial species plumule microstructure may optimize heat trapping in common eiders a diving duck that nests in arctic and subarctic waters plumule structure may have evolved to maximize cohesion over thermal insulation which would both reduce buoyancy during their foraging dives and enable nest down to withstand strong arctic winds
the contribution of mineral to the material properties of vertebral cartilage from the smooth hound shark mustelus californicus ||||| summary elasmobranch vertebral cartilage has a substantial mineral fraction and the arrangement of mineral varies among species we examined vertebrae from one shark species mustelus californicus to determine mineral content the effect of mineral on material properties and the viscoelastic response of vertebral cartilage we serially demineralized vertebrae and compressively tested them to failure at varying strain rates mineral in vertebral cartilage varies within individuals intraspecifically and interspecifically this is in contrast to bone in which significant variation in mineral content is pathological or an interspecific effect within mustelus vertebrae with larger mineral fractions were significantly stiffer and stronger however when variation is assessed across species the structure has a larger effect shark vertebral cartilage did not show a substantial viscoelastic response at biologically relevant strain rates validating the use of quasistatic testing for this material
the fine structure of odonata chromatophores ||||| abstract the appearance fine structure and pigment composition of the epidermal chromatophores of mature austrolestes annulosus lestidae are described and compared with the developing chromatophores of teneral austrolestes and the mature chromatophores of diphlebia lestoides amphipterygidae and ischnura heterosticta caenagrionidae mature chromatophores contain masses of near spherical light scattering bodies and larger irregularly shaped pigment vesicles these effect colour change by migrating in opposite directions through a system of interconnecting granular endoplasmic reticulum tubules the pigment a mixture of xanthommatin and dihydroxanthommatin has a liquid or gelatinous consistency developing chromatophores of teneral insects lack light scattering bodies and well defined migratory pigment vesicles but contain irregular masses of pigment of similar chemical composition
degradation of alkanes by bacteria ||||| pollution of soil and water environments by crude oil has been and is still today an important problem crude oil is a complex mixture of thousands of compounds among them alkanes constitute the major fraction alkanes are saturated hydrocarbons of different sizes and structures although they are chemically very inert most of them can be efficiently degraded by several microorganisms this review summarizes current knowledge on how microorganisms degrade alkanes focusing on the biochemical pathways used and on how the expression of pathway genes is regulated and integrated within cell physiology
surfactants tailored by the class actinobacteria ||||| globally the change towards the establishment of a bio based economy has resulted in an increased need for bio based applications this in turn has served as a driving force for the discovery and application of novel biosurfactants the class actinobacteria represents a vast group of microorganisms with the ability to produce a diverse range of secondary metabolites including surfactants understanding the extensive nature of the biosurfactants produced by actinobacterial strains can assist in finding novel biosurfactants with new potential applications this review therefore presents a comprehensive overview of the knowledge available on actinobacterial surfactants the chemical structures that have been completely or partly elucidated as well as the identity of the biosurfactant producing strains producer strains of not yet elucidated compounds are discussed as well as the original habitats of all the producer strains which seems to indicate that biosurfactant production is environmentally driven methodology applied in the isolation purification and structural elucidation of the different types of surface active compounds as well as surfactant activity tests are also discussed overall actinobacterial surfactants can be summarized to include the dominantly occurring trehalose comprising surfactants other non trehalose containing glycolipids lipopeptides and the more rare actinobacterial surfactants the lack of structural information on a large proportion of actinobacterial surfactants should be considered as a driving force to further explore the abundance and diversity of these compounds this would allow for a better understanding of actinobacterial surface active compounds and their potential for biotechnological application
self assembly of amorphous biophotonic nanostructures by phase separation ||||| some of the most vivid colors in the animal kingdom are created not by pigments but by wavelength selective scattering of light from nanostructures here we investigate quasi ordered nanostructures of avian feather barbs which produce vivid non iridescent colors these b keratin and air nanostructures are found in two basic morphologies tortuous channels and amorphous packings of spheres each class of nanostructure is isotropic and has a pronounced characteristic length scale of variation in composition these local structural correlations lead to strong backscattering over a narrow range of optical frequencies and little variation with angle of incidence such optical properties play important roles in social and sexual communication to be effective birds need to precisely control the development of these nanoscale structures yet little is known about how they grow we hypothesize that multiple lineages of birds have convergently evolved to exploit phase separation and kinetic arrest to self assemble spongy color producing nanostructures in feather barbs observed avian nanostructures are strikingly similar to those self assembled during the phase separation of fluid mixtures the channel and sphere morphologies are characteristic of phase separation by spinodal decomposition and nucleation and growth respectively these unstable structures are locked in by the kinetic arrest of the b keratin matrix likely through the entanglement or cross linking of supermolecular b keratin fibers using the power of self assembly birds can robustly realize a diverse range of nanoscopic morphologies with relatively small physical and chemical changes during feather development
water balance and osmoregulation in physadesmia globosa a diurnal tenebrionid beetle from the namib desert ||||| abstract dehydration days at degc of the namib tenebrionid beetle physadesmia globosa resulted in rapid weight loss approx and a substantial decline in haemolymph volume although the lipid content decreased significantly during this period metabolic water production was insufficient to maintain total body water rehydration no food resulted in increases in body weight and haemolymph volume sub normal and total body water to normality haemolymph osmolality sodium potassium and chloride concentrations increased during dehydration but despite a marked decrease in the volume of haemolymph changes in these parameters were subject to osmoregulatory control protein concentrations increased during dehydration and decreased during rehydration rapid rehydration h is well controlled while haemolymph volume increased dramatically haemolymph osmolality sodium potassium and chloride were strongly regulated however extended rehydration over days appears not to be as well managed by physadesmia with haemolymph osmolality and sodium concentrations decreasing despite no significant change in haemolymph volume from immediate post rehydration h values the potassium and chloride concentrations however appeared to be under stricter control during this period drinking when fog water is available probably contributes largely to the total water input of physadesmia and this together with efficient water conservation must serve to maintain effectively long term water balance in these insects
loss of top down biotic interactions changes the relative benefits for obligate mutualists ||||| the collapse of mutualisms owing to anthropogenic changes is contributing to losses of biodiversity top predators can regulate biotic interactions between species at lower trophic levels and may contribute to the stability of such mutualisms but they are particularly likely to be lost after disturbance of communities we focused on the mutualism between the fig tree ficus microcarpa and its host specific pollinator fig wasp and compared the benefits accrued by the mutualists in natural and translocated areas of distribution parasitoids of the pollinator were rare or absent outside the natural range of the mutualists where the relative benefits the mutualists gained from their interaction were changed significantly away from the plant s natural range owing to reduced seed production rather than increased numbers of pollinator offspring furthermore in the absence of the negative effects of its parasitoids we detected an oviposition range expansion by the pollinator with the use of a wider range of ovules that could otherwise have generated seeds loss of top down control has therefore resulted in a change in the balance of reciprocal benefits that underpins this obligate mutualism emphasizing the value of maintaining food web complexity in the anthropocene
aerodynamics of the hovering hummingbird ||||| despite profound musculoskeletal differences hummingbirds trochilidae are widely thought to employ aerodynamic mechanisms similar to those used by insects the kinematic symmetry of the hummingbird upstroke and downstroke has led to the assumption that these halves of the wingbeat cycle contribute equally to weight support during hovering as exhibited by insects of similar size this assumption has been applied either explicitly or implicitly in widely used aerodynamic models and in a variety of empirical tests here we provide measurements of the wake of hovering rufous hummingbirds selasphorus rufus obtained with digital particle image velocimetry that show force asymmetry hummingbirds produce of their weight support during the downstroke and only during the upstroke some of this asymmetry is probably due to inversion of their cambered wings during upstroke the wake of hummingbird wings also reveals evidence of leading edge vortices created during the downstroke indicating that they may operate at reynolds numbers sufficiently low to exploit a key mechanism typical of insect hovering hummingbird hovering approaches that of insects yet remains distinct because of effects resulting from an inherently dissimilar avian body plan
spider signals are web decorations visible to birds and bees ||||| we are becoming increasingly aware of animal communication outside the range of human sensitivity web decorations are silk structures used by orb web spiders to deceive prey and predators however despite the level of interest in these structures their visibility to prey and predators has never to our knowledge been objectively assessed here we use spectrophotometric analyses to show that the decorations of all five tested spider species are visible to honey bees and birds over short and long distances furthermore the discoid decorations of one species may provide some protection against arthropod predators however these decorations are inefficient at camouflaging the spider against birds despite the overlap between the spider s body and web decoration
adaptations to environmental extremes by multicellular organisms ||||| abstract microbes particularly archaea are well known for their superb adaptation to extreme environments however amazing adaptations to extreme stresses do not only occur in microbes but also in many multicellular organisms examples include tardigrades and their capability to survive freezing to near absolute zero the pompeii worm withstanding temperatures of up to degc the crucian carp remaining active in anoxic conditions for several months and resurrection plants which can survive near complete desiccation here we review some of the cryptobiotic strategies and adaptations exhibited in multicellular organisms and point out their relevance to astrobiology
adhesive recruitment by the viscous capture threads of araneoid orb weaving spiders ||||| summary the sticky prey capture threads of orb webs are critical to web performance by retaining insects that strike the web these spirally arrayed threads allow a spider time to locate and subdue prey the viscous capture threads spun by modern orb weaving spiders of the araneoidea clade replaced the dry fuzzy cribellar capture threads of the deinopoidea and feature regularly spaced moist adhesive droplets the stickiness of a cribellar thread is limited by its tendency to peel from a surface after the adhesion generated at the edges of contact is exceeded in this study we test the hypothesis that viscous thread overcomes this limitation by implementing a suspension bridge mechanism sbm that recruits the adhesion of multiple thread droplets we do so by using contact plates of four widths to measure the stickiness of six species viscous threads whose profiles range from small closely spaced droplets to large widely spaced droplets the increased stickiness registered by an increased number of thread droplets supports the operation of a sbm however the accompanying decrease in mean per droplet adhesion shows that droplets interior to the edges of thread contact contribute successively less adhesion models developed from these data suggest that the suspension bridge mechanism is limited to a span of approximately droplets
natural polyesters dufour s gland macrocyclic lactones form brood cell laminesters in colletes bees ||||| bees in the genus colletes make their brood cells in the ground and coat them with a highly resistant waterproof transparent membrane this membrane is a polyester constructed mainly from hydroxyoctadecanoic acid and hydroxy eicosanoic acid which are stored as their corresponding lactones in the dufour s gland of the bee when lining the cells the bee secretes its glandular content and the membrane is apparently a product of polycondensation reaction of its contents this appears to be the first report of a naturally occurring linear polyester the term laminester lamina layer ester for this class of compounds is proposed
forisomes calcium powered protein complexes with potential as smart biomaterials ||||| sieve tubes in legumes contain forisomes which are spindle like bodies that are composed of atp independent mechanically active proteins upon injury forisomes occlude sieve tubes by dispersion and thus help to prevent loss of nutrient rich transport sap forisome enlargement by dispersion is brought about by ca induced conformational changes that confer radial expansion and longitudinal contraction forisomes recontract upon ca removal in vitro forisomes reversibly disperse and contract in the presence or absence of ca respectively and at distinct phs recently forisomes have received renewed attention because of their unique capacity to convert chemical into mechanical energy independent of high energy organic compounds forisome based smart materials can be used to produce self powered monitoring and diagnostic systems here we focus on physiological chemical and physical aspects of forisomes and discuss their potential as biomimetic devices
subnanometer atomic force microscopy of peptide mineral interactions links clustering and competition to acceleration and catastrophe ||||| in vitro observations have revealed major effects on the structure growth and composition of biomineral phases including stabilization of amorphous precursors acceleration and inhibition of kinetics and alteration of impurity signatures however deciphering the mechanistic sources of these effects has been problematic due to a lack of tools to resolve molecular structures on mineral surfaces during growth here we report atomic force microscopy investigations using a system designed to maximize resolution while minimizing contact force by imaging the growth of calcium oxalate monohydrate under the influence of aspartic rich peptides at single molecule resolution we reveal how the unique interactions of polypeptides with mineral surfaces lead to acceleration inhibition and switching of growth between two distinct states interaction with the positively charged face of calcium oxalate monohydrate leads to formation of a peptide film but the slow adsorption kinetics and gradual relaxation to a well bound state result in time dependent effects these include a positive feedback between peptide adsorption and step inhibition described by a mathematical catastrophe that results in growth hysteresis characterized by rapid switching from fast to near zero growth rates for very small reductions in supersaturation interactions with the negatively charged face result in formation of peptide clusters that impede step advancement the result is a competition between accelerated solute attachment and inhibition due to blocking of the steps by the clusters the findings have implications for control of pathological mineralization and suggest artificial strategies for directing crystallization
defoliation of interior douglas fir elicits carbon transfer and stress signalling to ponderosa pine neighbors through ectomycorrhizal networks ||||| extensive regions of interior douglas fir pseudotsuga menziesii var glauca idf forests in north america are being damaged by drought and western spruce budworm choristoneura occidentalis this damage is resulting from warmer and drier summers associated with climate change to test whether defoliated idf can directly transfer resources to ponderosa pine pinus ponderosae regenerating nearby thus aiding in forest recovery we examined photosynthetic carbon transfer and defense enzyme response we grew pairs of ectomycorrhizal idf donor and ponderosa pine receiver seedlings in pots and isolated transfer pathways by comparing mm mm and no mesh treatments we then stressed idf donors either through manual defoliation or infestation by the budworm we found that manual defoliation of idf donors led to transfer of photosynthetic carbon to neighboring receivers through mycorrhizal networks but not through soil or root pathways both manual and insect defoliation of donors led to increased activity of peroxidase polyphenol oxidase and superoxide dismutase in the ponderosa pine receivers via a mechanism primarily dependent on the mycorrhizal network these findings indicate that idf can transfer resources and stress signals to interspecific neighbors suggesting ectomycorrhizal networks can serve as agents of interspecific communication facilitating recovery and succession of forests after disturbance
viscosin like lipopeptides from frog skin bacteria inhibit aspergillus fumigatus and batrachochytrium dendrobatidis detected by imaging mass spectrometry and molecular networking ||||| amphibian populations worldwide have declined and in some cases become extinct due to chytridiomycosis a pandemic disease caused by the fungus batrachochytrium dendrobatidis however some species have survived these fungal epidemics previous studies have suggested that the resistance of these species is due to the presence of cutaneous bacteria producing antifungal metabolites as our understanding of these metabolites is still limited we assessed the potential of such compounds against human relevant fungi such as aspergillus in this work we isolated bacterial strains from fifteen samples belonging to seven frog species collected in the highlands of panama and tested them against aspergillus fumigatus among the bacterial isolates that exhibited antifungal activity pseudomonas cichorii showed the greatest inhibition to visualize the distribution of compounds and identify them in the inhibition zone produced by p cichorii we employed maldi imaging mass spectrometry maldi ims and ms ms molecular networking we identified viscosin and massetolides a f g and h in the inhibition zone furthermore viscosin was isolated and evaluated in vitro against a fumigatus and b dendrobatidis showing mic values of ug ml and ug ml respectively this is the first report of cyclic depsipeptides with antifungal activity isolated from frog cutaneous bacteria
the function of terpene natural products in the natural world ||||| as the largest class of natural products terpenes have a variety of roles in mediating antagonistic and beneficial interactions among organisms they defend many species of plants animals and microorganisms against predators pathogens and competitors and they are involved in conveying messages to conspecifics and mutualists regarding the presence of food mates and enemies despite the diversity of terpenes known it is striking how phylogenetically distant organisms have come to use similar structures for common purposes new natural roles undoubtedly remain to be discovered for this large class of compounds given that such a small percentage of terpenes has been investigated so far
biophysics of catch bonds ||||| receptor ligand bonds strengthened by tensile mechanical force are referred to as catch bonds this review examines experimental data and biophysical theory to analyze why mechanical force prolongs the lifetime of these bonds rather than shortens the lifetime by pulling the ligand out of the binding pocket although many mathematical models can explain catch bonds experiments using structural variants have been more helpful in determining how catch bonds work the underlying mechanism has been worked out so far only for the bacterial adhesive protein fimh this protein forms catch bonds because it is allosterically activated when mechanical force pulls an inhibitory domain away from the ligand binding domain other catch bond forming proteins including blood cell adhesion proteins called selectins and the motor protein myosin show evidence of allosteric regulation between two domains but it remains unclear if this is related to their catch bond behavior
irregular fog as a water source for desert dune beetles ||||| summarythree methods of fog water uptake have been observed in three tribes of namib desert dune tenebrionid beetles adesmiini eurychorini and zophosini the methods used correlate with distribution and gross morphology of each species but cut across phylogenetic affinities of the three methods described none involve obvious fine anatomical or physical adaptations of the beetles for fog water uptake rather the beetles have evolved specific behavioural patterns for drinking water condensed on vegetation their own dorsum or sand use of fog water necessitates surface activity at times when surface temperatures and wind velocities are not optimal for these diurnal or crepuscular species behavioural adaptation has enabled these beetles to use irregular and unpredictable fogs as a moisture source
young s modulus varies with differential orientation of keratin in feathers ||||| feathers are composed of a structure that whilst being very light is able to withstand the large aerodynamic forces exerted upon them during flight to explore the contribution of molecular orientation to feather keratin mechanical properties we have examined the nanoscopic organisation of the keratin molecules by x ray diffraction techniques and have confirmed a link between this and the young s modulus of the feather rachis our results indicate that along the rachis length from calamus to tip the keratin molecules become more aligned than at the calamus before returning to a state of higher mis orientation towards the tip of the rachis we have also confirmed the general trend of increasing young s modulus with distance along the rachis furthermore we report a distinct difference in the patterns of orientation of beta keratin in the feathers of flying and flightless birds the trend for increased modulus along the feathers of volant birds is absent in the flightless ostrich
the role of seed banks in the vegetation dynamics of prairie glacial marshes ||||| the presence of viable seed in substrate samples from eagle lake a marsh in north central iowa was tested by placing subsamples of each sample under environmental conditions one set of subsamples was placed underwater submersed treatment seeds of species germinated and grew in this treatment on the average there were species sample the nd set of subsamples was kept moist simulating conditions on an exposed mud flat drawdown treatment in the drawdown treatment on the average seeds of species germinated sample altogether seeds of species germinated in this treatment of which only were also found in the submersed treatment by combining the results from the treatments the seed banks in the vegetation types studied were estimated to range from to seeds m on the average in the upper cm of soil field studies at eagle lake and goose lake when these marshes had no standing water revealed that the most abundant species whose seeds germinated on exposed mud flats were the same as the most abundant species in the experimental drawdown samples from eagle lake in when eagle lake had standing water again the submersed and floating species that were found were the same as those found in the experimental submersed samples from eagle lake the seed bank results and vegetation sampling reveal that there are types of species present in prairie marsh seed banks emergent species typha scirpus sparganium sagittaria germinate on exposed mud flats or in very shallow water submersed and free floating species lemna spirodela ceratophyllum naias potamogeton whose dormant seeds or turions can survive on exposed mud flats for a year and which germinate when there is standing water and mud flat species bidens cyperus polygonum and rumex which are ephemerals whose seeds can only germinate on exposed mud flats during periods when no standing water exists in the marsh because of drought or water level manipulation when the marsh refloods these species are eliminated from the visible marsh flora primarily because of fluctuating water levels and muskrat damage prairie marshes have cyclical changes in their vegetation during which mud flat emergent or submersed and free floating species replace each other as the dominant type of species in a marsh
absence of eye shine and tapetum in the heterogeneous eye of anthocharis butterflies pieridae ||||| summary insect eyes are composed of spectrally heterogeneous ommatidia typically with three different types the ommatidial heterogeneity in butterflies can be identified non invasively by the colorful eye shine the reflection from the tapetal mirror located at the proximal end of the ommatidia which can be observed by epi illumination microscopy since the color of eye shine is determined by the spectral properties of the ommatidia it has been tentatively related to color vision in the course of a survey of ommatidial heterogeneity in butterflies we found that members of the pierid genus anthocharis lack the eye shine we therefore carried out anatomy of the eye of the yellow tip anthocharis scolymus and correlated it with the absence of the tapetum the butterfly tapetum is a remnant of the ancestral moth tapetum a trait that has been completely lost in the papilionids and also as now appears in the genus anthocharis anatomical investigations also revealed that considering rhabdom shape peri rhabdomal pigment clusters and autofluorescence the ommatidia can be divided in at least two different types which are randomly distributed in the retina
barnacle cement a polymerization model based on evolutionary concepts ||||| summary enzymes and biochemical mechanisms essential to survival are under extreme selective pressure and are highly conserved through evolutionary time we applied this evolutionary concept to barnacle cement polymerization a process critical to barnacle fitness that involves aggregation and cross linking of proteins the biochemical mechanisms of cement polymerization remain largely unknown we hypothesized that this process is biochemically similar to blood clotting a critical physiological response that is also based on aggregation and cross linking of proteins like key elements of vertebrate and invertebrate blood clotting barnacle cement polymerization was shown to involve proteolytic activation of enzymes and structural precursors transglutaminase cross linking and assembly of fibrous proteins proteolytic activation of structural proteins maximizes the potential for bonding interactions with other proteins and with the surface transglutaminase cross linking reinforces cement integrity remarkably epitopes and sequences homologous to bovine trypsin and human transglutaminase were identified in barnacle cement with tandem mass spectrometry and or western blotting akin to blood clotting the peptides generated during proteolytic activation functioned as signal molecules linking a molecular level event protein aggregation to a behavioral response barnacle larval settlement our results draw attention to a highly conserved protein polymerization mechanism and shed light on a long standing biochemical puzzle we suggest that barnacle cement polymerization is a specialized form of wound healing the polymerization mechanism common between barnacle cement and blood may be a theme for many marine animal glues
lunar rhythm in the emergence of an ephemeropteran ||||| in a paper published in hora suggests that the swarming of some ephemeroptera is related to the lunar cycle evidence has been obtained which suggests that povilla adusta navas a mayfly widely distributed in central and southern africa shows such a rhythm of emergence in uganda the interest of this lies in the fact that very few examples are known of lunar rhythms in non marine animals see gaspers
self propelled dropwise condensate on superhydrophobic surfaces ||||| in conventional dropwise condensation on a hydrophobic surface the condensate drops must be removed by external forces for continuous operation this letter reports continuous dropwise condensation spontaneously occurring on a superhydrophobic surface without any external forces the spontaneous drop removal results from the surface energy released upon drop coalescence which leads to a surprising out of plane jumping motion of the coalesced drops at a speed as high as m s the jumping follows an inertial capillary scaling and gives rise to a micrometric average diameter at steady state
adaptations of frogs to survive freezing ||||| five species of frogs from north a n e n c a survive extensive freezing of their body fluids to temperatures as low as deg c for periods lasting at least wk these frogs hibernate in leaf litter where subzero temperatures commonly occur during the winter the onset of freezing triggers liver glycogenolysis and the production of high concentrations of glucose or glycerol to x normal that functions as a cryoprotectant against freezing injury concomitantly the release of the latent heat of crystallization as body water freezes promotes the continued function of the cardiovascular system for many hours and serves to distribute glucose throughout the body the water content of major organs is reduced by u or more during the first h of freezing wlth the water being relocated and frozen in other body spaces organ dehydration functions to concentrate cryoprotectant and to reduce mechanical damage by ice during freezing as freezing progresses breathing heart beat and most other v t a l functions cease but reanimation occurs v t h l n a few hours after thawing the evolution of freeze tolerance in these animals illustrates the h gh ly flexible capacities of frogs to adapt to stressful environments
characterization of mechanisms for ca and hco co acquisition for shell formation in embryos of the freshwater common pond snail lymnaea stagnalis ||||| summary the freshwater common pond snail lymnaea stagnalis produces embryos that complete direct development hatching as shell bearing individuals within days despite relatively low ambient calcium and carbonate availability this development is impaired by removal of ambient total calcium but not by removal of bicarbonate and or carbonate in this study we utilized pharmacological agents to target possible acquisition pathways for both ca and accumulation of carbonate in post metamorphic shell laying embryos using whole egg mass flux measurements and ion specific microelectrode analytical techniques we have demonstrated that carbonic anhydrase catalyzed hydration of co is central in the acquisition of both shell forming ions because it provides the hydrogen ions for an electrogenic vacuolar type h atpase that fuels the uptake of ca via voltage dependent ca channels and possibly an electrogenic ca h exchanger additionally co hydration provides an endogenous source of hco thus hydration of endogenous co forms hco for calcification while hydrogen ions are excreted contributing to continued ca uptake as well as creating favorable alkaline internal conditions for calcification the connections between ca and hco acquisition mechanisms that we describe here provide new insight into this efficient embryonic calcification in freshwater
stratum corneum keratin structure function and formation the cubic rod packing and membrane templating model ||||| a new model for stratum corneum keratin structure function and formation is presented the structural and functional part of the model which hereafter is referred to as the cubic rod packing model postulates that stratum corneum keratin intermediate filaments are arranged according to a cubic like rod packing symmetry with or without the presence of an intracellular lipid membrane with cubic like symmetry enveloping each individual filament the new model could account for i the cryo electron density pattern of the native corneocyte keratin matrix ii the x ray diffraction patterns iii the swelling behavior and iv the mechanical properties of mammalian stratum corneum the morphogenetic part of the model which hereafter is referred to as the membrane templating model postulates the presence in cellular space of a highly dynamic small lattice parameter nm membrane structure with cubic like symmetry to which keratin is associated it further proposes that membrane templating rather than spontaneous self assembly is responsible for keratin intermediate filament formation and dynamics the new model could account for i the cryo electron density patterns of the native keratinocyte cytoplasmic space ii the characteristic features of the keratin network formation process iii the dynamic properties of keratin intermediate filaments iv the close lipid association of keratin v the insolubility in non denaturating buffers and pronounced polymorphism of keratin assembled in vitro and vi the measured reduction in cell volume and hydration level between the stratum granulosum and stratum corneum further using cryo transmission electron microscopy on native fully hydrated vitreous epidermis we show that the subfilametous keratin electron density pattern consists both in corneocytes and in viable keratinocytes of one axial subfilament surrounded by an undetermined number of peripheral subfilaments forming filaments with a diameter of approximately nm
diffractive hygrochromic effect in the cuticle of the hercules beetle dynastes hercules ||||| the elytra from dry specimens of the hercules beetle dynastes hercules appear khaki green in a dry atmosphere and turn black passively under high humidity levels new scanning electron images spectrophotometric measurements and physical modelling are used to unveil the mechanism of this colouration switch the visible dry state greenish colouration originates from a widely open porous layer located mm below the cuticle surface the structure of this layer is three dimensional with a network of filamentary strings arranged in layers parallel to the cuticle surface and stiffening an array of strong cylindrical pillars oriented normal to the surface unexpectedly diffraction plays a significant role in the broadband colouration of the cuticle in the dry state the backscattering caused by this layer disappears when water infiltrates the structure and weakens the refractive index differences
directional dependence of hydroxyapatite collagen interactions on mechanics of collagen ||||| bone is a biological nanocomposite composed primarily of collagen and hydroxyapatite the collagen molecules self assemble to from a structure known as a fibril that comprises of about of the total bone protein in a fibril the molecular level interactions at the interface between molecular collagen and hydroxyapatite nanocrystals have a significant role on its mechanical response in this study we have used molecular dynamics and steered molecular dynamics to study directional dependence of deformation response of collagen with respect to the hydroxyapatite surface we have also studied mechanical response of collagen in the proximity of and surfaces of hydroxyapatite our simulations indicate that the mechanics of collagen pulled in different directions with respect to hydroxyapatite is significantly different similar results were obtained for collagen pulled in the proximity of different crystallographic surfaces of hydroxyapatite

colour producing b keratin nanofibres in blue penguin eudyptula minor feathers ||||| the colours of living organisms are produced by the differential absorption of light by pigments e g carotenoids melanins and or by the physical interactions of light with biological nanostructures referred to as structural colours only two fundamental morphologies of non iridescent nanostructures are known in feathers and recent work has proposed that they self assemble by intracellular phase separation processes here we report a new biophotonic nanostructure in the non iridescent blue feather barbs of blue penguins eudyptula minor composed of parallel b keratin nanofibres organized into densely packed bundles synchrotron small angle x ray scattering and two dimensional fourier analysis of electron micrographs of the barb nanostructure revealed short range order in the organization of fibres at the appropriate size scale needed to produce the observed colour by coherent scattering these two dimensional quasi ordered penguin nanostructures are convergent with similar arrays of parallel collagen fibres in avian and mammalian skin but constitute a novel morphology for feathers the identification of a new class of b keratin nanostructures adds significantly to the known mechanisms of colour production in birds and suggests additional complexity in their self assembly
influence of neighboring plants on the dynamics of an ant acacia protection mutualism ||||| ant plant protection symbioses in which plants provide food and or shelter for ants in exchange for protection from herbivory are model systems for understanding the ecology of mutualism while interactions between ants host plants and herbivores have been intensively studied we know little about how plant plant interactions influence the dynamics of these mutualisms despite strong evidence that plants compete for resources that hosting ants can be costly and that host plant provisioning to ants can therefore be constrained by resource availability we used field experiments in a semiarid kenyan savanna to examine interactions between the ant plant acacia drepanolobium neighboring grasses and two species of symbiotic acacia ants with divergent behaviors crematogaster mimosae an aggressive symbiont that imposes high costs to host trees via consumption of extrafloral nectar and tetraponera penzigi a less protective symbiont that imposes lower costs because it does not consume nectar we hypothesized that by competing with acacias for resources neighboring grasses reduce hosts ability to support costly c mimosae while having little or no effect on the ability of hosts to support low cost t penzigi and reduce sapling growth rates irrespective of ant occupant we factorially manipulated the presence absence of grasses and the identity of ant occupants on saplings and evaluated effects on colony survivorship and sapling growth rates over weeks contrary to prediction the high cost high reward nectar dependent mutualist c mimosae had higher colony survival rates on saplings with grass neighbors present grasses appear to have indirectly facilitated the survival of c mimosae by reducing water stress on host plants soils under saplings shaded by grasses had higher moisture content and these saplings produced more active nectaries than grass removal saplings consistent with prediction survival of low cost low reward t penzigi did not differ significantly between grass removal treatments saplings occupied by low cost low reward t penzigi grew more on average than saplings occupied by high cost high reward c mimosae demonstrating that mutualist partner identity strongly and differentially influences demographic rates of young plants in contrast contrary to prediction grass neighbors had no significant net impact on sapling growth rates our results suggest that neighboring plants can exert strong and counterintuitive effects on ant plant protection symbioses highlighting the need to integrate plant plant interactions into our understanding of these mutualisms
surface structure and frictional properties of the skin of the amazon tree boa corallus hortulanus squamata boidae ||||| the legless locomotion of snakes requires specific adaptations of their ventral scales to maintain friction force in different directions the skin microornamentation of the snake corallus hortulanus was studied by means of scanning electron microscopy and the friction properties of the skin were tested on substrates of different roughness skin samples from various parts of the body dorsal lateral ventral were compared dorsal and lateral scales showed similar net like microornamentation and similar friction coefficients average friction coefficients for dorsal and lateral scales on the epoxy resin surfaces were and respectively in contrast ventral scales possess ridges running parallel to the longitudinal body axis they demonstrated a significantly lower friction coefficient compared to both dorsal and lateral scales on average in addition ventral scales showed frictional anisotropy comparing longitudinal and perpendicular direction of the ridges this study clearly demonstrates that different skin microstructure is responsible for different frictional properties in different body regions
cnidocyst structure and the biomechanics of discharge ||||| the cnidocyst is the defining organelle of the cnidarians used for capture of prey and defense it consists of a cylindrical capsule which releases a long tubule upon triggering cnidocysts develop inside a giant post golgi vesicle by a sequential accumulation of proteins from the golgi apparatus traditionally three types of cnidocysts are distinguished nematocysts spirocysts and ptychocysts here we focus on nematocysts the prototypic cnidocyst and by far most diverse group of cnidocysts in this phylum the mature nematocyst capsule comprises a collagenous polymer with remarkable biophysical properties able to withstand an osmotic pressure of bar release of the capsule and discharge is probably initiated by classical exocytosis high speed studies revealed the kinetics of discharge to be as short as ns generating an acceleration of x g and a pressure of gpa at the site of impact of the spines onto the prey thus nematocysts comprise a powerful molecular spring mechanism releasing energy stored in the wall polymer in the nanosecond time range during the last few years genomic biochemical and structural studies have helped to unravel the molecular composition of the nematocyst supra structure here we summarize these findings and present an integrative view of mechanical and molecular aspects that have shaped the nematocyst during evolution
stationary underwater prey missed by reef herons egretta gularis head position and light refraction at the moment of strike ||||| summarythis paper attempts to verify the importance of spatial positioning of the eyes of reef heronsegretta gularis schistacea when coping with light refraction at the air water interface the herons striking of prey while their approach angle was restricted was observed a the herons capture success in the restricted situation was markedly lower than in the unrestricted situation b the points of strike str in unsuccessful strikes differed from those of successful strikes and from those of the unrestricted situation c the larger the difference between the observed and the predicted ratio of prey depth to apparent prey depth the higher the probability of missing a prey these results support predictions of a model presented elsewhere katzir and intrator that a heron will attempt to reach spatial positions at which prey s real depth and apparent depth are linearly correlated
how tussocks structure sedge meadow vegetation ||||| carex stricta dominates sedge meadows in southern wisconsin usa in contrast with invasive species that dominate as monotypes c stricta supports a diversity of co occurring species by forming tussocks concerns about diversity loss and the potential to restore species rich tussocks led us to ask how tussocks foster high species richness and affect composition our study of tussocks at three sites showed that tussocks structure sedge meadow vegetation by adding both surface area and micro habitats tussocks which average cm tall increase surface area of an otherwise flat plot by species richness was positively correlated with tussock size but the patterns differed among sites at a site where water was deep tussock height was the best predictor of richness at two other sites surface area and circumference were the best predictors micro habitats differed in conditions and species composition tussock tops were high in light variable in temperature and high in litter cover tussock sides had less litter but more moss off tussock areas tended to be aquatic of the taxa found showed significant affinities for one or more micro habitats of these four species occurred primarily on tops several extended from tops to lower levels seven aquatic taxa preferred areas off tussocks and one species specialized in tussock sides over the growing season species richness increased in an additive process from species in may to in september cover of litter and moss increased and bare surface decreased with season but only seven of the taxa with micro site preferences expanded their distributions as the september drawdown exposed the off tussock micro habitat we conclude that tussocks enhance species richness in three ways by increasing surface area by providing multiple micro habitats and by undergoing seasonal changes in composition our detailed data on plant diversity support by large tussocks form a benchmark for tussock meadow conservation as well as a target for restoration of degraded meadows
dew condensation on desert beetle skin ||||| some tenebrionind beetles inhabiting the namib desert are known for using their body to collect water droplets from wind blown fogs we aim to determine whether dew water collection is also possible for desert insects for this purpose we investigated the infra red emissivity and the wetting and structural properties of the surface of the elytra of a preserved specimen of physasterna cribripes tenebrionidae beetle where the macro structure appears as a series of bumps with valleys between them dew formation experiments were carried out in a condensation chamber the surface properties infra red emissivity wetting properties were dominated by the wax at the elytra surface and to a lower extent its micro structure we performed scanning electron microscope on histological sections and determined the infra red emissivity using a scanning pyrometer the emissivity measured between mm was close to the black body value dew formation occurred on the insect s elytra which can be explained by these surface properties from the surface coverage of the condensed drops it was found that dew forms primarily in the valleys between the bumps the difference in droplet nucleation rate between bumps and valleys can be attributed to the hexagonal microstructure on the surface of the valleys whereas the surface of the bumps is smooth the drops can slide when they reach a critical size and be collected at the insect s mouth graphical abstract
integumental water movement and rate of water ingestion during rain harvesting in the texas horned lizard phrynosoma cornutum ||||| capture of rainfall on skin surfaces and its transport via capillary channels between scales to the mouth for drinking has been documented in a few agamid moloch and phrynocephalus and iguanid phrynosoma spp lizards associated behaviors include a postural stance and jaw motions this experimental study documents that rate of jaw opening and closing cycles is positively correlated with rate of water delivery to lizards backs and to gain in mass of lizards attributable to drinking the mean mass of water that can be held by the interscalar capillary flow system is correlated with body size smaller lizards holding a larger percentage of their body mass in the rain harvesting system ingestion mechanisms for water flow from the integumental channels to the mouth surfaces for drinking are discussed with note being made of the possible roles of a fold of skin at the jaw angle at the postlabial scales and tongue actions recent hatchlings exhibit rain harvesting behavior suggesting its innate nature
extreme impact and cavitation forces of a biological hammer strike forces of the peacock mantis shrimp odontodactylus scyllarus ||||| summary mantis shrimp are renowned for their unusual method of breaking shells with brief powerful strikes of their raptorial appendages due to the extreme speeds of these strikes underwater cavitation occurs between their appendages and hard shelled prey here we examine the magnitude and relative contribution of the impact and cavitation forces generated by the peacock mantis shrimp odontodactylus scyllarus we present the surprising finding that each strike generates two brief high amplitude force peaks typically ms apart based on high speed imaging force measurements and acoustic analyses it is evident that the first force peak is caused by the limb s impact and the second force peak is due to the collapse of cavitation bubbles peak limb impact forces range from to n and peak cavitation forces reach n despite their small size o scyllarus can generate impact forces thousands of times their body weight furthermore on average cavitation peak forces are of the limb s impact force although cavitation forces may exceed the limb impact forces by up to the rapid succession of high peak forces used by mantis shrimp suggests that mantis shrimp use a potent combination of cavitation forces and extraordinarily high impact forces to fracture shells the stomatopod s hammer is fundamentally different from typical shell crushing mechanisms such as fish jaws and lobster claws and may have played an important and as yet unexamined role in the evolution of shell form
adhesion of single bacterial cells in the micronewton range ||||| the adhesion of bacteria to surfaces plays critical roles in the environment disease and industry in aquatic environments caulobacter crescentus is one of the first colonizers of submerged surfaces using a micromanipulation technique we measured the adhesion force of single c crescentus cells attached to borosilicate substrates through their adhesive holdfast the detachment forces measured for cells ranged over to micron averaging micron based on the calculation of stress distribution with the finite element analysis method dividing an object into small grids and calculating relevant parameters for all of the elements the adhesion strength between the holdfast and the substrate is n mm in the central region of contact to our knowledge this strength of adhesion is the strongest ever measured for biological adhesives
a finite element simulation scheme for biological muscular hydrostats ||||| an explicit finite element scheme is developed for biological muscular hydrostats such as squid tentacles octopus arms and elephant trunks the scheme is implemented by embedding muscle fibers in finite elements in any given element the fiber orientation can be assigned arbitrarily and multiple muscle directions can be simulated the mechanical stress in each muscle fiber is the sum of active and passive parts the active stress is taken to be a function of activation state muscle fiber shortening velocity and fiber strain while the passive stress depends only on the strain this scheme is tested by simulating extension of a squid tentacle during prey capture our numerical predictions are in close correspondence with existing experimental results it is shown that the present finite element scheme can successfully simulate more complex behaviors such as torsion of a squid tentacle and the bending behavior of octopus arms or elephant trunks
barotolerance of fungi isolated from deep sea sediments of the indian ocean ||||| two species of filamentous fungi aspergiuus ustus bain thom church and graphium sp were isolated from calcareous animal shells at depths of m in the arabian sea and m in the bay of bengal laboratory experiments showed germination of conidia growth of hyphae and microconidiation in both the fungi at bar pressure at and degc suggesting barotolerance the fungi also secreted barotolerant protease under these conditions protease synthesised and secreted in cultures grown at bar was also active under bar pressure at and degc at o c the fungi showed better conidial germination growth and protease secretion when subjected to bar than when grown at atmosphere the results indicate barotolerance of terrestrial species of fungl and suggest that they might be active under deep sea conditions

chameleons have independent eye movements but synchronise both eyes during saccadic prey tracking ||||| abstract the movements of both eyes and the head were recorded with search coils in unrestrained freely moving chameleons as a main result i found that the generation of saccades in the left and the right eye was either independent from each other or was highly correlated according to the behavioural situation when no prey item was fixated disconjugate saccades were observed which was in accordance with earlier observations in chameleons during prey tracking the chameleons switched to a different oculomotor behaviour and pursued the moving prey with synchronous saccades at higher target velocities the tracking movement of the head was also saccadic and was synchronised with the two eyes binocular coupling affected only the timing of the saccades but not the metrics the amplitudes of the synchronous saccades were usually different in the two eyes these observations suggest the existence of two independent premotor neuronal circuits for left and right eye saccadic motor control in the chameleon binocular coupling in prey tracking chameleons is probably achieved by neuronal coupling of these premotor circuits during eye head coordination the ability to switch between synchronous and uncoupled saccadic eye movements has not been described for any other vertebrate this unique ability of the chameleon may help to understand the organisation of the oculomotor system of other vertebrates since evidence for separate left eye and right eye saccade generation and position control has recently also been reported in primates
insect odorscapes from plant volatiles to natural olfactory scenes ||||| olfaction is an essential sensory modality for insects and their olfactory environment is mostly made up of plant emitted volatiles the terrestrial vegetation produces an amazing diversity of volatile compounds which are then transported mixed and degraded in the atmosphere each insect species expresses a set of olfactory receptors that bind part of the volatile compounds present in its habitat insect odorscapes are thus defined as species specific olfactory spaces dependent on the local habitat and dynamic in time manipulations of pest insect odorscapes are a promising approach to answer the strong demand for pesticide free plant protection strategies moreover understanding their olfactory environment becomes a major concern in the context of global change and environmental stresses to insect populations a considerable amount of information is available on the identity of volatiles mediating biotic interactions that involve insects however in the large body of research devoted to understanding how insects use olfaction to locate resources an integrative vision of the olfactory environment has rarely been reached this article aims to better apprehend the nature of the insect odorscape and its importance to insect behavioral ecology by reviewing the literature specific to different disciplines from plant ecophysiology to insect neuroethology first we discuss the determinants of odorscape composition from the production of volatiles by plants section plant metabolism and volatile emissions to their filtering during detection by the olfactory system of insects section insect olfaction how volatile plant compounds are encoded and integrated by the olfactory system we then summarize the physical and chemical processes by which volatile chemicals distribute in space section transportation of volatile plant compounds and spatial aspects of the odorscape and time section temporal aspects the dynamics of the odorscape in the atmosphere the following sections consider the ecological importance of background odors in odorscapes and how insects adapt to their olfactory environment habitat provides an odor background and a sensory context that modulate the responses of insects to pheromones and other olfactory signals section ecological importance of odorscapes in addition insects do not respond inflexibly to single elements in their odorscape but integrate several components of their environment section plasticity and adaptation to complex and variable odorscapes we finally discuss existing methods of odorscape manipulation for sustainable pest insect control and potential future developments in the context of agroecology section odorscapes in plant protection and agroecology
characterization of two new multiforms of trametes pubescens laccase ||||| electrochemical properties of two multiforms of laccase from trametes pubescens basidiomycete lac and lac have been studied the standard redox potentials of the t sites of the enzymes were found to be and mv vs nhe for lac and lac respectively bioelectroreduction of oxygen based on direct electron transfer between each of the two forms of trametes pubescens laccase and spectrographic graphite electrodes has been demonstrated and studied it is concluded that the t site of laccase is the first electron acceptor both in solution homogeneous case and when the enzymes are adsorbed on the surface of the graphite electrode heterogeneous case thus the previously proposed mechanism of oxygen bioelectroreduction by adsorbed fungal laccase was additionally confirmed using two forms of the enzyme moreover the assumed need for extracellular laccase to communicate directly and electronically with a solid matrix lignin in the course of lignin degradation is discussed in summary the possible roles of multiforms of the enzyme based on their electrochemical biochemical spectral and kinetic properties have been suggested to consist in broadening of the substrate specificity of the enzyme in turn yielding the possibility to dynamically regulate the process of lignin degradation according to the real time survival needs of the organism
plasticity in light reactions of photosynthesis for energy production and photoprotection ||||| plant photosynthesis channels some of the most highly reactive intermediates in biology in a way that captures a large fraction of their energy to power the plant a viable photosynthetic apparatus must not only be efficient and robust machinery but also well integrated into the plant s biochemical and physiological networks this requires flexibility in its responses to the dramatically changing environmental conditions and biochemical demands first the output of the energy storing light reactions must match the demands of plant metabolism second regulation of the antenna must be flexible to allow responses to diverse challenges that could result in excess light capture and subsequent photoinhibition evidence is presented for the interplay of two types of mechanistic flexibility one that modulates the relative sensitivity of antenna down regulation to electron flow and the other which primarily modulates the output ratio of atp nadph but also contributes to down regulation

how snapping shrimp snap through cavitating bubbles ||||| the snapping shrimp alpheus heterochaelis produces a loud snapping sound by an extremely rapid closure of its snapper claw one of the effects of the snapping is to stun or kill prey animals during the rapid snapper claw closure a high velocity water jet is emitted from the claw with a speed exceeding cavitation conditions hydrophone measurements in conjunction with time controlled high speed imaging of the claw closure demonstrate that the sound is emitted at the cavitation bubble collapse and not on claw closure a model for the bubble dynamics based on a rayleigh plesset type equation quantitatively accounts for the time dependence of the bubble radius and for the emitted sound
cnidocyte mechanoreceptors are tuned to the movements of swimming prey by chemoreceptors ||||| cnidocytes the stinging cells of cnidarians discharge nematocysts in response to physical contact accompanied by the stimulation of specific chemoreceptors cnidocytes in fishing tentacles of a sea anemone are now found to discharge nematocysts preferentially into targets vibrating at and to hertz moreover in the presence of submicromolar concentrations of known chemosensitizers such as n acetylated sugars and mucin these optima shift to and hertz frequencies that correspond to the movements of swimming prey hence chemoreceptors for these substances tune cnidocyte mechanoreceptors to frequencies that match the movements of the prey
glueomics an expression survey of the adhesive gland of the sandcastle worm ||||| random clones were sequenced from a cdna library constructed from the adhesive gland of phragmatopoma californica a marine polycheate that builds protective shells by gluing together sand grains and biogenic mineral fragments as many as new proteins and two phenoloxidase enzymes were found that may be structural components of or involved in processing the bioadhesive glue protein classification was based on the following criteria i the presence of predicted secretion signal peptides ii low complexity sequences iii strongly skewed amino acid compositions enriched with g y k h a or s iv repeating peptide motifs and v homology to known glue proteins other structural proteins or enzymes the new genes provide probes for further characterization of the adhesive gland as well as potential biotechnological resources and insight
why some leaves are anthocyanic and why most anthocyanic leaves are red ||||| abstract the adaptive significance of leaf reddening as it occurs during specific developmental stages or after stress has puzzled biologists for more than a century theoretically the accumulation of a non photosynthetic pigment competing with chlorophylls for photon capture would impose a photosynthetic cost which should be paid off by the benefits afforded by anthocyanins under some circumstances hence the proposed hypotheses presume protective functions against excess light uv b radiation reactive oxygen species water stress osmoregulation and herbivory the existing arguments in favor of an anti oxidant anti uv b and osmoregulatory role are confounded by the co occurrence in leaves of other compounds having the same properties not absorbing visible light attaining much higher concentrations and in some cases having a more appropriate location to fulfill the ascribed functions moreover the excess light hypothesis should take into account that anthocyanins mainly absorb green photons which are used photosynthetically in deeper cell layers needing less photoprotection the more ecological anti herbivore hypotheses consider red leaf color as a signal denoting high defensive commitment as a camouflage obscuring the green reflectance indicative of a healthy leaf and or as a device undermining the folivorous insects camouflage the anti herbivore hypotheses have not been thoroughly tested yet they are compatible with the known optical preferences of insects and their underlying physiology overall although a multiplicity of potential roles can be argued the primary role may depend on the reference system i e species developmental stage or specific biotic and abiotic stressors
the ant plants myrmecodia and hydnophytum rubiaceae and the relationships between their morphology ant occupants physiology and ecology ||||| summary the history of investigation of the ant plants is briefly reviewed and the external morphology of the plants described within papua new guinea ant plants are abundant in open canopied environments and less common but more diverse in rain forest they also occur terrestrially above m initial tuber development was found to be similar that described by treub later cavities are formed by successive increasingly complex phellogens in certain myrmecodia spp later cavities are differentiated into regions with distinct surface characteristics shapes and positions cavities in hydnophytum are simpler in shape but sometimes differentiated in other ways the anatomy of the cavity surfaces especially the putative absorption sites warts is described the ant iridomyrmex cordatus which is common in ant plants in other regions is found in ant plants in open habitats in papua new guinea but is replaced by i cf scrutator in rain forest and above m two fungi known also from ant plants in java miehe a occur in the cavities of ant plants throughout papua new guinea arthrocladium sp papend grows on cavity surfaces where ant faecal material is present and the other an unidentified monilialine fungus is parasitic on smooth clean surfaces the former is most common and the latter almost confined to myrmecodia spp occupied by iridomyrmex cordatus experiments suggested that both hydnophytum under artificial conditions and myrmecodia under field conditions grow better in the presence than absence of iridomyrmex cordatus and that the stimulus might be that of minerals supplied by the ants radioisotopes in both organic and inorganic compounds fed to i cordatus were deposited preferentially by the ants on the warted cavity surfaces where ant faecal material was present and were absorbed by the plants in the discussion it is argued that the plant ant relationship has had a considerable influence on both the ecology and evolution of the plants but that this varies in different species
trap geometry in three giant montane pitcher plant species from borneo is a function of tree shrew body size ||||| three bornean pitcher plant species nepenthes lowii n rajah and n macrophylla produce modified pitchers that capture tree shrew faeces for nutritional benefit tree shrews tupaia montana feed on exudates produced by glands on the inner surfaces of the pitcher lids and defecate into the pitchers here we tested the hypothesis that pitcher geometry in these species is related to tree shrew body size by comparing the pitcher characteristics with those of five other typical arthropod trapping nepenthes species we found that only pitchers with large orifices and lids that are concave elongated and oriented approximately at right angles to the orifice capture faeces the distance from the tree shrews food source that is the lid nectar glands to the front of the pitcher orifice precisely matches the head plus body length of t montana in the faeces trapping species and is a function of orifice size and the angle of lid reflexion substantial changes to nutrient acquisition strategies in carnivorous plants may occur through simple modifications to trap geometry this extraordinary plant animal interaction adds to a growing body of evidence that nepenthes represents a candidate model for adaptive radiation with regard to nitrogen sequestration strategies
the dehesa system of southern spain and portugal as a natural ecosystem mimic ||||| the dehesas of the southwestern iberian peninsula are man made ecosystems characterised by a savannah like physiognomy the trees are viewed as an integrated part of the system and as a result are planted managed and regularly pruned palynological and historical evidence of the manipulation of initial ecosystems by man to obtain a savannah like ecosystem is presented the ecological functions of the tree are detailed using results obtained at two complementary scales at the local scale strong soil structural differences and functional differences in water budget and patterns of water use are observed under and outside the tree canopy using the concept of ecosystem mimicry the two coexistent components of dehesas can be compared to two distant stages of a secondary succession characterised by very different behaviours at the regional scale evidence of relationships between tree density and mean annual precipitation over more than km suggests that the structure of these man made agroecosystems have adjusted over the long term and correspond to an optimal functional equilibrium based on the hydrological equilibrium hypothesis finally the future of dehesas in the face of contemporary exogenous threats of economic and global environmental origin is discussed
biological characterization of the skin of shortfin mako shark isurus oxyrinchus and preliminary study of the hydrodynamic behaviour through computational fluid dynamics ||||| this study characterized the morphology density and orientation of the dermal denticles along the body of a shortfin mako shark isurus oxyrinchus and identified the hydrodynamic parameters of its body through a computational fluid dynamics model the study showed a great variability in the morphology size shape orientation and density of dermal denticles along the body of i oxyrinchus there was a significant higher density in dorsal and ventral areas of the body and their highest angular deviations were found in the lower part of the mouth and in the areas between the pre caudal pit and the second dorsal and pelvic fins a detailed three dimensional geometry from a scanned body of a shark was carried out to evaluate the hydrodynamic properties such as drag coefficient lift coefficient and superficial skin friction coefficient of the skin together with flow velocity field according to different roughness coefficients simulating the effect of the dermal denticles this preliminary approach contributed to detailed information of the denticle interactions as the height of the denticles was increased flow velocity and the effect of lift decreased whereas drag increased the highest peaks of skin friction coefficient were observed around the pectoral fins
biology of wolbachia ||||| wolbachia are a common and widespread group of bacteria found in reproductive tissues of arthropods these bacteria are transmitted through the cytoplasm of eggs and have evolved various mechanisms for manipulating reproduction of their hosts including induction of reproductive incompatibility parthenogenesis and feminization wolbachia are also transmitted horizontally between arthropod species significant recent advances have been made in the study of these interesting microorganisms in this paper wolbachia biology is reviewed including their phylogeny and distribution mechanisms of action population biology and evolution and biological control implications potential directions for future research are also discussed
probing the molecular and electronic structure of norhipposudoric and hipposudoric acids from the red sweat of hippopotamus amphibius a dft investigation ||||| molecular structure and tautomeric conformational preferences of norhipposudoric and hipposudoric acids the recently isolated pigments of the hippopotamus amphibius sweat were investigated using the density functional theory dft pbe formalism among a large variety of possible structures two similar keto enol tautomer conformers are nearly isoenergetic and markedly more stable than the others both in the gas phase and aqueous solution the bulk solvent effect was accounted for with the polarizable continuum model pcm a distinctive structural feature is the strong intramolecular hydrogen bonding in the keto enol o h o bridge as shown by analysis of the atoms in molecules topological properties of the electron density to elucidate the claimed strong acidity of these pigments the site specific microscopic dissociation constants were also calculated using the cluster continuum model a hybrid approach based on inclusion of explicit solvent molecules and solvation of the cluster by the dielectric continuum notably the first deprotonation should occur predominantly from the enolic group with a remarkably low pk i value this factor could play an important role in the potent antibiotic activity of the pigments the absorption spectra of the undissociated and dissociated compounds in aqueous solution were interpreted with time dependent dft pcm calculations the pi pi diquinoid excitations mainly occurring in the fluorenoid nucleus are the major contributors to the color and strong absorption bands in the uva and uvb regions which are closely related to the efficient sunscreen activity exerted by the pigments
lipids of the stratum corneum vary with cutaneous water loss among larks along a temperature moisture gradient ||||| we explored the relationship between lipids of the stratum corneum sc the barrier to water vapor diffusion of the skin and cutaneous water loss cwl of species of free living larks along a temperature moisture gradient our results showed that free fatty acids cholesterol and ceramides were the major constituents of sc in larks from different environments including the netherlands a mesic environment iran a semiarid region and several areas in saudi arabia a hot dry desert we found that cwl was reduced among larks inhabiting deserts but our data did not support the hypothesis that birds from desert environments have larger quantities of lipids per unit dry mass of the sc than larks from more mesic environments instead larks in arid environments had a higher proportion of ceramides especially the more polar fractions and a smaller proportion of free fatty acids in their sc an adjustment that apparently reduced their cwl subtle changes in the ratios of lipid classes can apparently alter the movement of water vapor through the skin we hypothesize that desert birds have higher proportions of ceramides in their sc and lower proportions of free fatty acids because this combination allows the lipid lamellae to exist in a more highly ordered crystalline phase and consequently creates a tighter barrier to water vapor diffusion
scientific research and essays ||||| 
bacterial recognition of mineral surfaces nanoscale interactions between shewanella and a feooh ||||| force microscopy has been used to quantitatively measure the infinitesimal forces that characterize interactions betweenshewanella oneidensis a dissimilatory metal reducing bacterium and goethite a feooh both commonly found in earth near surface environments force measurements with subnanonewton resolution were made in real time with living cells under aerobic and anaerobic solutions as a function of the distance in nanometers between a cell and the mineral surface energy values in attojoules joules derived from these measurements show that the affinity between s oneidensis and goethite rapidly increases by two to five times under anaerobic conditions in which electron transfer from bacterium to mineral is expected specific signatures in the force curves suggest that a kilodalton putative iron reductase is mobilized within the outer membrane of s oneidensis and specifically interacts with the goethite surface to facilitate the electron transfer process
reserves resilience and dynamic landscapes ||||| abstract in a world increasingly modified by human activities the conservation of biodiversity is essential as insurance to maintain resilient ecosystems and ensure a sustainable flow of ecosystem goods and services to society however existing reserves and national parks are unlikely to incorporate the long term and large scale dynamics of ecosystems hence conservation strategies have to actively incorporate the large areas of land that are managed for human use for ecosystems to reorganize after large scale natural and human induced disturbances spatial resilience in the form of ecological memory is a prerequisite the ecological memory is composed of the species interactions and structures that make ecosystem reorganization possible and its components may be found within disturbed patches as well in the surrounding land scape present static reserves should be complemented with dynamic reserves such as ecological fallows and dynamic successional reserves that are part of ecosystem management mimicking natural disturbance regimes at the landscape level
water homeostasis in bees with the emphasis on sociality ||||| summary avenues of water gain and loss in bees are examined here at two levels of organisation the individual and the colony compared with the majority of terrestrial insects bees have a high water turnover this is due to their nectar diet and in larger species substantial metabolic water production during flight counteracted by high evaporative and excretory losses water fluxes at the colony level can also be very high when incoming nectar is dilute honeybees need to remove large volumes of water by evaporation on the other hand water is not stored in the nest and must be collected for evaporative cooling and for feeding the brood water regulation has many similarities at individual and colony levels in particular manipulation of nectar or water on the tongue is extensively used by bees to increase evaporation for either food concentrating or cooling purposes
biodegradation of volatile organic compounds by five fungal species ||||| abstract five fungal species cladosporium resinae atcc cladosporium sphaerospermum atcc exophiala lecanii corni cbs mucor rouxii atcc and phanerochaete chrysosporium atcc were tested for their ability to degrade nine compounds commonly found in industrial off gas emissions fungal cultures inoculated on ceramic support media were provided with volatile organic compounds vocs via the vapor phase as their sole carbon and energy sources compounds tested included aromatic hydrocarbons benzene ethylbenzene toluene and styrene ketones methyl ethyl ketone methyl isobutyl ketone and methyl propyl ketone and organic acids n butyl acetate ethyl ethoxypropionate experiments were conducted using three ph values ranging from to fungal ability to degrade each voc was determined by observing the presence or absence of visible growth on the ceramic support medium during a day test period results indicate that e lecanii corni and c sphaerospermum can readily utilize each of the nine vocs as a sole carbon and energy source p chrysosporium was able to degrade all vocs tested except for styrene under the conditions imposed c resinae was able to degrade both organic acids all of the ketones and some of the aromatic compounds ethylbenzene and toluene however it was not able to grow utilizing benzene or styrene under the conditions tested with the vocs tested m rouxii produced visible growth only when supplied with n butyl acetate or ethyl ethoxypropionate maximum growth for most fungi was observed at a ph of approximately the experimental protocol utilized in these studies is a useful tool for assessing the ability of different fungal species to degrade gas phase vocs under conditions expected in a biofilter application
the calcareous egg capsule of the patagonian neogastropod odontocymbiola magellanica morphology secretion and mineralogy ||||| odontocymbiola magellanica is the only known south american volutid gastropod that deposits calcareous egg capsules the spawn is moulded and fixed to flat or convex surfaces by the female s ventral pedal gland during an hours long process in which the female adopts a stereotyped posture and appears nonreactive to most external stimuli microscopically the different cells of the ventral pedal gland show features suggesting their participation in the secretion of both the organic matrix and the calcium component of the calcareous layer the latter consists mainly of numerous spherspherulites that are packed together around cylindrical septated spaces which traverse the spherspherulitic layer and attach to the membranous layers surrounding the capsule cavity these septated spaces should ensure permeability of the capsule wall which is necessary for gas exchange and excretion by the embryo the calcareous layer is made of high magnesium calcite a calcium carbonate polymorph in which ca is partially substituted by mg in the calcite lattice mg substitution is thought to confer a greater crack resistance to the mineral it is found in many invertebrates but apparently has not been reported before in molluscs odontocymbiola magellanica is a long lived species investing heavily in its egg capsules
smart swarms of bacteria inspired agents with performance adaptable interactions ||||| collective navigation and swarming have been studied in animal groups such as fish schools bird flocks bacteria and slime molds computer modeling has shown that collective behavior of simple agents can result from simple interactions between the agents which include short range repulsion intermediate range alignment and long range attraction here we study collective navigation of bacteria inspired smart agents in complex terrains with adaptive interactions that depend on performance more specifically each agent adjusts its interactions with the other agents according to its local environment by decreasing the peers influence while navigating in a beneficial direction and increasing it otherwise we show that inclusion of such performance dependent adaptable interactions significantly improves the collective swarming performance leading to highly efficient navigation especially in complex terrains notably to afford such adaptable interactions each modeled agent requires only simple computational capabilities with short term memory which can easily be implemented in simple swarming robots
the lantern shark s light switch turning shallow water crypsis into midwater camouflage ||||| bioluminescence is a common feature in the permanent darkness of the deep sea in fishes light is emitted by organs containing either photogenic cells intrinsic photophores which are under direct nervous control or symbiotic luminous bacteria symbiotic photophores whose light is controlled by secondary means such as mechanical occlusion or physiological suppression the intrinsic photophores of the lantern shark etmopterus spinax were recently shown as an exception to this rule since they appear to be under hormonal control here we show that hormones operate what amounts to a unique light switch by acting on a chromatophore iris which regulates light emission by pigment translocation this result strongly suggests that this shark s luminescence control originates from the mechanism for physiological colour change found in shallow water sharks that also involves hormonally controlled chromatophores the lantern shark would have turned the initial shallow water crypsis mechanism into a midwater luminous camouflage more efficient in the deep sea environment
entrapment of bed bugs by leaf trichomes inspires microfabrication of biomimetic surfaces ||||| resurgence in bed bug infestations and widespread pesticide resistance have greatly renewed interest in the development of more sustainable environmentally friendly methods to manage bed bugs historically in eastern europe bed bugs were entrapped by leaves from bean plants which were then destroyed this purely physical entrapment was related to microscopic hooked hairs trichomes on the leaf surfaces using scanning electron microscopy and videography we documented the capture mechanism the physical impaling of bed bug feet tarsi by these trichomes this is distinct from a velcro like mechanism of non piercing entanglement which only momentarily holds the bug without sustained capture struggling trapped bed bugs are impaled by trichomes on several legs and are unable to free themselves only specific mechanically vulnerable locations on the bug tarsi are pierced by the trichomes which are located at effective heights and orientations for bed bug entrapment despite a lack of any evolutionary association using bean leaves as templates we microfabricated surfaces indistinguishable in geometry from the real leaves including the trichomes using polymers with material properties similar to plant cell walls these synthetic surfaces snag the bed bugs temporarily but do not hinder their locomotion as effectively as real leaves
tree shrew lavatories a novel nitrogen sequestration strategy in a tropical pitcher plant ||||| nepenthes pitcher plants are typically carnivorous producing pitchers with varying combinations of epicuticular wax crystals viscoelastic fluids and slippery peristomes to trap arthropod prey especially ants however ant densities are low in tropical montane habitats thereby limiting the potential benefits of the carnivorous syndrome nepenthes lowii a montane species from borneo produces two types of pitchers that differ greatly in form and function pitchers produced by immature plants conform to the typical nepenthes pattern catching arthropod prey however pitchers produced by mature n lowii plants lack the features associated with carnivory and are instead visited by tree shrews which defaecate into them after feeding on exudates that accumulate on the pitcher lid we tested the hypothesis that tree shrew faeces represent a significant nitrogen n source for n lowii finding that it accounts for between and per cent of foliar n in mature n lowii plants thus n lowii employs a diversified n sequestration strategy gaining access to a n source that is not available to sympatric congeners the interaction between n lowii and tree shrews appears to be a mutualism based on the exchange of food sources that are scarce in their montane habitat
mechanical adaptations of a giant kelp ||||| unusually high extensibility of the kelp nereocystis luetkeana minimizes breakage by waves and tidal currents cellulose fibrils in cortical cell walls have a preferred angle of deg to the stipe axis this may be the structural basis of stipe extensibility although undamaged plants can sustain drag due to most waves and tides breakage of single plants occurs most often at flaws in the stipes caused by sea urchin grazing or by abrasion
divergent investment strategies of acacia myrmecophytes and the coexistence of mutualists and exploiters ||||| ant plant interactions represent a diversity of strategies from exploitative to mutualistic and how these strategies evolve is poorly understood here we link physiological ecological and phylogenetic approaches to study the evolution and coexistence of strategies in the acacia pseudomyrmex system host plant species represented different strategies high reward hosts produced significantly more extrafloral nectar efn food bodies and nesting space than low reward hosts even when being inhabited by the same species of ant mutualist high reward hosts were more effectively defended against herbivores and exploited to a lower extent by nondefending ants than low reward hosts at the phenotypic level secretion of efn and ant activity were positively correlated and a mutualistic ant species induced nectar secretion whereas a nondefending exploiter did not all of these mechanisms contribute to the stable association of high reward hosts with defending ant species however exploiter ants are less dependent on the host derived rewards and can colonize considerable proportions of the low reward hosts mapping these strategies onto phylogenetic trees demonstrated that the low reward hosts represent the derived clade within a monophyletic group of obligate ant plants and that the observed exploiter ant species evolved their strategy without having a mutualistic ancestor we conclude that both types of host strategies coexist because of variable net outcomes of different investment payoff regimes and that the effects of exploiters on the outcome of mutualisms can thus increase the diversity within the taxa involved
freeze tolerance and postfreeze recovery in the frog pseudacris crucifer ||||| this study characterizes freeze tolerance and postfreeze recovery in the frog pseudacris crucifer we collected frogs from pennsylvania during the autumns of and all experiments occurred in the laboratory and employed a freezing temperature of c this treatment froze of the body water in these frogs and they were clearly tolerant of internal freezing however their survival was inversely proportional to freeze duration day day and day cutaneous blood flow breathing hind leg retraction righting reflex and jumping ability returned to surviving frogs within h following the conclusion of a day freeze complex behavioral responses e g jumping required more time to return than did basic physiological functions e g cutaneous blood flow interestingly rates of oxygen consumption were not altered during the recovery period with respect to the prefreeze value this study indicates that the freezing survival of p crucifer is markedly influenced by the duration of the freeze episode which may be an important ecological limitation during winters having few intervening thaws recovering frogs require days to fully regain complex motor responses whereas vital functions are restored quickly and oxygen consumption is not measurably altered during this period
iron conservation by reduction of metalloenzyme inventories in the marine diazotroph crocosphaera watsonii ||||| the marine nitrogen fixing microorganisms diazotrophs are a major source of nitrogen to open ocean ecosystems and are predicted to be limited by iron in most marine environments here we use global and targeted proteomic analyses on a key unicellular marine diazotroph crocosphaera watsonii to reveal large scale diel changes in its proteome including substantial variations in concentrations of iron metalloproteins involved in nitrogen fixation and photosynthesis as well as nocturnal flavodoxin production the daily synthesis and degradation of enzymes in coordination with their utilization results in a lowered cellular metalloenzyme inventory that requires less iron than if these enzymes were maintained throughout the diel cycle this strategy is energetically expensive but appears to serve as an important adaptation for confronting the iron scarcity of the open oceans a global numerical model of ocean circulation biogeochemistry and ecosystems suggests that crocosphaera s ability to reduce its iron metalloenzyme inventory provides two advantages it allows crocosphaera to inhabit regions lower in iron and allows the same iron supply to support higher crocosphaera biomass and nitrogen fixation than if they did not have this reduced iron requirement
enzymatic conversion of co to bicarbonate in functionalized mesoporous silica ||||| we report here a concept converting carbon dioxide to biocarbonate in a biomimetic nanoconfiguration carbonic anhydrase ca the fastest enzyme that can covert carbon dioxide to bicarbonate can be spontaneously entrapped in carboxylic acid group functionalized mesoporous silica hooc fms with super high loading density up to mg of protein mg of fms in sharp contrast to normal porous silica the binding of ca to hooc fms resulted in a partial conformational change comparing to the enzyme free in solution but it can be overcome with increased protein loading density the higher the protein loading density the less conformational change hence the higher enzymatic activity and the higher enzyme immobilization efficiency up to the released enzyme still displayed the native conformational structure and the same high enzymatic activity as that prior to the enzyme entrapment indicating that the conformational change resulted from the electrostatic interaction of ca with hooc fms was not permanent this work may provide a new approach converting carbon dioxide to biocarbonate that can be integrated with the other part of biosynthesis process for the assimilation of carbon dioxide
fuel powered artificial muscles ||||| artificial muscles and electric motors found in autonomous robots and prosthetic limbs are typically battery powered which severely restricts the duration of their performance and can necessitate long inactivity during battery recharge to help solve these problems we demonstrated two types of artificial muscles that convert the chemical energy of high energy density fuels to mechanical energy the first type stores electrical charge and uses changes in stored charge for mechanical actuation in contrast with electrically powered electrochemical muscles only half of the actuator cycle is electrochemical the second type of fuel powered muscle provides a demonstrated actuator stroke and power density comparable to those of natural skeletal muscle and generated stresses that are over a hundred times higher
why tree crop interactions in agroforestry appear at odds with tree grass interactions in tropical savannahs ||||| this paper describes recent research findings on resource sharing between trees and crops in the semiarid tropics and attempts to reconcile this information with current knowledge of the interactions between savannah trees and understorey vegetation by examining agroforestry systems from the perspective of succession in general productivity of natural vegetation under savannah trees increases as rainfall decreases while the opposite occurs in agroforestry one explanation is that in the savannah the beneficial effects of microclimatic improvements e g lower temperatures and evaporation losses are greater in more xeric environments mature savannah trees have a high proportion of woody above ground structure compared to foliage so that the amount of water saved largely by reduction in soil evaporation is greater than water lost through transpiration by trees by contrast in agroforestry practices such as alley cropping where tree density is high any beneficial effects of the trees on microclimate are negated by reductions in soil moisture due to increasing interception losses and tree transpiration while investment in woody structure can improve the water economy beneath agroforestry trees it inevitably reduces the growth rate of the trees and thus increases the time required for improved understorey productivity therefore agroforesters prefer trees with more direct and immediate benefits to farmers the greatest opportunity for simultaneous agroforestry practices is therefore to fill niches within the landscape where resources are currently under utilised by crops in this way agroforestry can mimic the large scale patch dynamics and successional progression of a natural ecosystem
whisker like geometries and their force reduction properties ||||| this paper studies the effects of geometrical features on harbor seal whiskers on its force reduction ability each feature in the seal whisker is sequentially stripped from the original whisker shape four whisker like geometries are created from such methodology d simulations of flow around the structures are performed and the resulting forces on the structures are non dimensionalized the lift and drag coefficients of these structures are compared to the real whisker case the undulations on minor and major axes are found to be necessary in reducing the lift forces existence of only one of the undulations fails to weaken the flow and break the vortex tubes and braids in the wake the offset angle between leading edge and trailing edge are found to have slight effects on the lift and drag coefficients the reduction in drag coefficient is found to be dependent on the existence of undulations in minor axis the force responses of whisker like geometries with undulations on one of their axes are found to be periodic when the force response on whisker like geometries with both undulations are found to be chaotic vortex shedding frequency of the structure is observed to decrease considerably when no offset angle is introduced into the geometry this may result in longer lifespan of the structure
temporal patterns of emergence in aquatic insects ||||| in aquatic insects emergence ecdysis to the adult or subimaginal stage varies widely in temporal pattern the comparative study of this pattern is feasible and informative in orders such as plecoptera ephemeroptera odonata diptera and trichoptera in which all members of a population pass through the water surface when emerging methods by which emergence rate can be measured are discussed four basic temporal patterns of emergence exist emergence may be continuous with irregular fluctuations in rate rhythmic with a lunar period sporadic occurring at irregular intervals of a few days or seasonal examples of each of these patterns are given and reference is made to the proximate and ultimate environmental factors which may be maintaining the patterns observed diurnal rhythms of emergence are excluded from consideration when emergence is restricted seasonally in temperate latitudes the degree of its synchronization within the emergence period varies widely but is usually constant and typical for a given species this has provided the basis for an ecological classification of british odonata the validity of which is examined in the light of recent research
nanomorphology of the blue iridescent wings of a giant tropical wasp megascolia procer javanensis hymenoptera ||||| the wings of the giant wasp megascolia procer javanensis are opaque and iridescent the origin of the blue green iridescence is studied in detail using reflection spectroscopy scanning electron microscopy and physical modeling it is shown that the structure responsible for the iridescence is a single homogeneous transparent chitin layer covering the whole surface of each wing the opacity is essentially due to the presence of melanin in the stratified medium which forms the mechanical core of the wing
first insights into the chemical defensive system of the erotylid beetle tritoma bipustulata ||||| the present study provides the first insights into the chemical defensive system of the erotylid beetle tritoma bipustulata and furthermore reports the previously hardly known ability of abdominal reflex bleeding in this coleopteran family the defensive chemistry of the secretion of pronotal glands abdominal reflex blood as well as of the haemolymph were analysed by gc ms the different secretions were dominated by aromatic compounds in addition we detected alkenes ketones organic acids as well as a single sesquiterpene the majority of these detected compounds had strong antimicrobial properties in microbiological assays with entomopathogenic micro organisms in feeding bioassays with ants only benzyl alcohol benzothiazole indole and methylindole detected in the abdominal reflex blood were significantly deterrent
hurricane hugo wind damage to southeastern u s coastal forest tree species ||||| one percent of hobcaw forest a ha tract in south carolina s lower coastal plain was inventoried with fixed area plots within four months after the eye of hurricane hugo passed km south of the forest results of this sampling confirmed our hypotheses that the amount and nature of hurricane wind damage differed among the tree species sampled approximately percent of the trees inventoried were either not damaged or had light crown damage longleaf pine pinus palustris was less damaged than loblolly pine pinus taeda or pond pine pinus serotina bald cypress taxodium distichum suffered light crown damage upland oaks were more heavily damaged than the pine species live oak quercus virginiana was less damaged than laurel oak quercus laurifolia and water oak quercus nigra those tree species commonly found in the lower coastal plain longleaf pine bald cypress and live oak suffered less damage than species with larger natural ranges
the exploitation of mutualisms ||||| mutualisms interspecific cooperative interactions are ubiquitously exploited by organisms that obtain the benefits mutualists offer while delivering no benefits in return the natural history of these exploiters is well described but relatively little effort has yet been devoted to analysing their ecological or evolutionary significance for mutualism exploitation is not a unitary phenomenon but a set of loosely related phenomena exploiters may follow mixed strategies or pure strategies at either the species or individual level may or may not be derived from mutualists and may or may not inflict significant costs on mutualisms the evolutionary implications of these different forms of exploitation especially the threats they pose to the stability of mutualism have as yet been minimally explored studies of this issue are usually framed in terms of a temptation to defect that generates a destabilizing conflict of interest between partners i argue that this idea is in fact rather inappropriate for interpreting most observed forms of exploitation in mutualisms i suggest several alternative and testable ideas for how mutualism can persist in the face of exploitation

food dissemination in ants robustness of the trophallactic network against resource quality ||||| abstract insect societies are often composed of many individuals achieving collective decisions that depend on environmental and colonial characteristics for example ants are able to focus their foraging effort on the most rewarding food source while this phenomenon is well known the link between the food source quality and the intranidal food dissemination networks and its dynamics has been neglected here we analysed the global dynamics of food dissemination in camponotus cruentatus workers after feeding on a low mol l or on a high mol l sucrose concentration food source we also analysed the trophallaxis activity at the individual level and built the complete network of trophallaxis the results reveal that the dynamics of food dissemination and the structure of the trophallaxis network are robust and independent of the food concentration we discuss these results in the light of recent advances in the study of efficiency in food management in ants summary ants show a robust network of food dissemination that is not dependent on the quality of the food
function of spiral grain in trees ||||| summarythrough spiral grain conduits for sap lead from each root to all branches this uniform distribution of sap is indicated by the paths of vessels and tracheids and has been proven experimentally by means of dyed sap injected into the base of stems or taken up by roots trees receiving water only from roots at one side of the root collar nevertheless stay green and continue growing spiral grain in bark distributes food from each branch to other flanks of the stem and to most roots experimental interruptions of the sap and food conduits caused the cambial zone to reorient new conduit cells in new directions bypassing the interruption in particular spiral grooves cut into the stem surface caused spiral grain the new cells reorient through division and growth although spiral grain is largely under genetic control trees appear to have a spiral grain especially where needed for distribution of water when root spheres are dry at one side compared with straight grained trees spiral grained stems and branches bend and twist more when exposed to strong wind in this way offering less wind resistance and being less likely to break through the bending and twisting snow slides down from branches rather than breaking them but the main function of spiral grain is the uniform distribution of supplies from each root to all branches and from each branch to many roots
blue luminescence of ripening bananas ||||| as revealed in the last two decades chlorophyll breakdown in senescent leaves appears to occur by a largely common and well controlled catabolic path which rapidly furnishes non fluorescent colorless chlorophyll catabolites nccs as final products recently nccs detected in ripe apples and pears were found to be the same as those in degreened leaves suggesting chlorophyll catabolism in leaf senescence and fruit ripening to be similar scheme
cooperating to compete altruism sexual selection and causes of male reproductive cooperation ||||| competition among males for access to reproductive opportunities is a central tenet of behavioural biology that has critical implications for studies of mating systems sexual selection and the evolution of numerous phenotypic traits given the expectation that males should compete vigorously for access to females it may at first seem paradoxical that males in some species cooperate to reproduce often resulting in the apparent sacrifice of direct fitness by some members of these cooperative partnerships because this form of cooperation lies at the interface between natural sexual and kin selection studies of the adaptive consequences of male reproductive cooperation may yield important insights into how complex and sometimes conflicting selective pressures shape individual behaviour here we define and review examples of reproductive cooperation among male animals we take an integrative approach to reviewing the potential causes of maleemale cooperation including potential adaptive hypotheses ecological correlates phylogenetic patterns and physiological mechanisms the impact of male reproductive cooperation on sexual selection theory is also discussed we conclude by outlining several important directions for future research including efforts to improve understanding of the ecological and demographic contexts in which male reproductive cooperation occurs collectively such analyses promise to improve our understanding of multiple fundamental concepts in evolutionary biology the authors published on behalf of the association for the study of animal behaviour by elsevier ltd all rights reserved
adaptable defense a nudibranch mucus inhibits nematocyst discharge and changes with prey type ||||| nudibranchs that feed on cnidarians must defend themselves from the prey s nematocysts or risk their own injury or death while a nudibranch s mucus has been thought to protect the animal from nematocyst discharge an inhibition of discharge by nudibranch mucus has never been shown the current study investigated whether mucus from the aeolid nudibranch aeolidia papillosa would inhibit nematocyst discharge from four species of sea anemone prey sea anemone tentacles were contacted with mucus coated gelatin probes and nematocyst discharge was quantified and compared with control probes of gelatin only mucus from a papillosa inhibited the discharge of nematocysts from sea anemone tentacles this inhibition was specifically limited to the anemone species on which the nudibranch had been feeding when the prey species was changed the mucus changed within weeks to inhibit the nematocyst discharge of the new prey species the nudibranchs apparently produce the inhibitory mucus rather than simply becoming coated in anemone mucus during feeding because of the intimate association between most aeolid nudibranchs and their prey an adaptable mucus protection could have a significant impact on the behavior distribution and life history of the nudibranchs
correlation between aquaporin and water permeability in response to vasotocin hydrin and b adrenergic effectors in the ventral pelvic skin of the tree frog hyla japonica ||||| summary the ventral pelvic skin of the tree frog hyla japonica expresses two kinds of arginine vasotocin avt stimulated aquaporins aqp h and aqp h which affect the capacity of the frog s skin to absorb water as such it can be used as a model system for analyzing the molecular mechanisms of water permeability we investigated aqp dynamics and water permeability in the pelvic skin of h japonica following challenge with avt hydrins intermediate peptides of pro avt and b adrenergic effectors in the in vivo experiment both aqp h and aqp h proteins were translocated to the apical plasma membrane in the principal cells of the first reacting cell frc layer in the pelvic skin following challenge with avt hydrin and hydrin thereby increasing the water permeability of the pelvic skin the b adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol ip and its anatagonist propranolol pp in combination with avt or hydrins were used as challenge in the in vitro experiment ip increased water permeability whereas pp inhibited it and both events were well correlated with the translocation of the aqps to the apical membrane in the pp avt treated skins labels for aqp h and aqp h were differentially visible among the principal cells the apical plasma membrane of some cells was labeled while others were not indicating that the response of pp or avt is different from cell to cell these results provide morphological evidence that the principal cells of the frc layers may have two kinds of receptors a v receptor and b adrenergic receptor
direct numerical simulation of sharkskin denticles in turbulent channel flow ||||| the hydrodynamic function of sharkskin has been under investigation for the past years current literature conflicts on whether sharkskin is able to reduce skin friction similar to riblets to contribute insights toward reconciling these conflicting views direct numerical simulations are carried out to obtain detailed flow fields around realistic denticles a sharp interface immersed boundary method is employed to simulate two arrangements of actual sharkskin denticles from isurus oxyrinchus in a turbulent boundary layer at ret for comparison turbulent flow over drag reducing scalloped riblets is also simulated with similar flow conditions and with the same numerical method although the denticles resemble riblets both sharkskin arrangements increase total drag by while the riblets reduce drag by analysis of the simulated flow fields shows that the turbulent flow around denticles is highly three dimensional and separated with of the total drag being form drag the complex three dimensional shape of the denticles gives rise to a mean flow dominated by strong secondary flows in sharp contrast with the mean flow generated by riblets which is largely two dimensional the so resulting three dimensionality of sharkskin flows leads to an increase in the magnitude of the turbulent statistics near the denticles which further contributes to increasing the total drag the simulations also show that at least for the simulated arrangements sharkskin in sharp contrast with drag reducing riblets is unable to isolate high shear stress near denticle ridges causing a significant portion of the denticle surface to be exposed to high mean shear
cytoplasmic free ca in arabidopsis roots changes in response to touch but not gravity ||||| changes in cytoplasmic ca concentration ca i have been proposed to be involved in signal transduction pathways in response to a number of stimuli including gravity and touch the current hypothesis proposes that the development of gravitropic bending is correlated with a redistribution of ca i in gravistimulated roots however no study has demonstrated clearly the development of an asymmetry of this ion during root curvature we tested this hypothesis by quantifying the temporal and spatial changes in ca i in roots of living arabidopsis seedlings using ultraviolet confocal ca ratio imaging and vertical stage fluorescence microscopy to visualize root ca i we observed no changes in ca i associated with the graviresponse whether monitored at the whole organ level or in individual cells in different regions of the root for up to h after gravistimulation however touch stimulation led to transient increases in ca i in all cell types monitored the increases induced in the cap cells were larger and longer lived than in cells in the meristematic or elongation zone one millimolar la and mu m verapamil did not prevent these responses whereas mm egta or mu m ruthenium red inhibited the transients indicating an intracellular origin of the ca increase these results suggest that although touch responses of roots may be mediated through a ca dependent pathway the gravitropic response is not associated with detectable changes in ca i
bacterial microcompartments ||||| bacterial microcompartments bmcs are self assembling organelles that consist of an enzymatic core that is encapsulated by a selectively permeable protein shell the potential to form bmcs is widespread and found across the kingdom bacteria bmcs have crucial roles in carbon dioxide fixation in autotrophs and the catabolism of organic substrates in heterotrophs they contribute to the metabolic versatility of bacteria providing a competitive advantage in specific environmental niches although bmcs were first visualized more than years ago it is mainly in the past decade that progress has been made in understanding their metabolic diversity and the structural basis of their assembly and function this progress has not only heightened our understanding of their role in microbial metabolism but is also beginning to enable their use in a variety of applications in synthetic biology in this review we focus on recent insights into the structure assembly diversity and function of bmcs

analysis of an ultra hard magnetic biomineral in chiton radular teeth ||||| recent analyses of the ultrastructural and mechanical properties of mineralized biological materials have demonstrated some common architectural features that can help explain their observed damage tolerance nature has accomplished this feat through the precise control of anisotropic crystal nucleation and growth processes in conjunction with nanoscale control over the self assembly of spatially distinct organic and inorganic phases resulting in effective inhibition of crack propagation through these materials one such example is found in the hyper mineralized and abrasion resistant radular teeth of the chitons a group of herbivorous marine mollusks who have the surprising capacity to erode away the rocky substrates on which they graze through the use of modern microscopy and nanomechanical characterization techniques we describe the architectural and mechanical properties of the radular teeth from cryptochiton stelleri chiton teeth are shown to exhibit the largest hardness and stiffness of any biominerals reported to date being notably as much as three fold harder than human enamel and the calcium carbonate based shells of mollusks we explain how the unique multi phasic design of these materials contributes not only to their functionality but also highlights some interesting design principles that might be applied to the fabrication of synthetic composites
the weak interfaces within tough natural composites experiments on three types of nacre ||||| mineralization is a typical strategy used in natural materials to achieve high stiffness and hardness for structural functions such as skeletal support protection or predation high mineral content generally leads to brittleness yet natural materials such as bone mollusk shells or glass sponge achieve relatively high toughness considering the weakness of their constituents through intricate microstructures in particular nanometers thick organic interfaces organized in micro architectures play a key role in providing toughness by various processes including crack deflection crack bridging or energy dissipation while these interfaces are critical in these materials their composition structure and mechanics is often poorly understood in this work we focus on nacre one of the most impressive hard biological materials in terms of toughness we performed interfacial fracture tests on chevron notched nacre samples from three different species red abalone top shell and pearl oyster we found that the intrinsic toughness of the interfaces is indeed found to be extremely low in the order of the toughness of the mineral inclusions themselves such low toughness is required for the cracks to follow the interfaces and to deflect and circumvent the mineral tablets this result highlights the efficacy of toughening mechanisms in natural materials turning low toughness inclusions and interfaces into high performance composites we found that top shell nacre displayed the highest interfacial toughness because of higher surface roughness and a more resilient organic material and also through extrinsic toughening mechanisms including crack deflection crack bridging and process zone in the context of biomimetics the main implication of this finding is that the interface in nacre like composite does not need to be tough the extensibility or ductility of the interfaces may be more important than their strength and toughness to produce toughness at the macroscale
hydrodynamic design of the humpback whale flipper ||||| the humpback whale megaptera novaeangliae is reported to use its elongate pectoral flippers during swimming maneuvers the morphology of the flipper from a m whale was evaluated with regard to this hydrodynamic function the flipper had a wing like high aspect ratio plan form rounded tubercles were regularly interspersed along the flipper s leading edge the flipper was cut into cm cross sections and photographed except for sections near the distal tip flipper sections were symmetrical with no camber flipper sections had a blunt rounded leading edge and a highly tapered trailing edge placement of the maximum thickness placement for each cross section varied from of chord at the tip to at mid span section thickness ratio averaged with a range of the humpback whale flipper had a cross sectional design typical of manufactured aerodynamic foils for lift generation the morphology and placement of leading edge tubercles sugges that they function as enhanced lift devices to control flow over the flipper and maintain lift at high angles of attack the morphology of the humpback whale flipper suggests that it is adapted for high maneuverability associated with the whale s unique feeding behavior c wiley liss inc
life on the rocks ||||| biofilms are interface micro habitats formed by microbes that differ markedly from those of the ambient environment the term subaerial biofilm sab was coined for microbial communities that develop on solid mineral surfaces exposed to the atmosphere subaerial biofilms are ubiquitous self sufficient miniature microbial ecosystems that are found on buildings bare rocks in deserts mountains and at all latitudes where direct contact with the atmosphere and solar radiation occurs subaerial biofilms on exposed terrestrial surfaces are characterized by patchy growth that is dominated by associations of fungi algae cyanobacteria and heterotrophic bacteria inherent subaerial settlers include specialized actinobacteria e g geodermatophilus cyanobacteria and microcolonial fungi individuals within sab communities avoid sexual reproduction but cooperate extensively with one another especially to avoid loss of energy and nutrients subaerial biofilm metabolic activity centres on retention of water protecting the cells from fluctuating environmental conditions and solar radiation as well as prolonging their vegetative life atmospheric aerosols gases and propagatory particles serve as sources of nutrients and inoculum for these open communities subaerial biofilms induce chemical and physical changes to rock materials and they penetrate the mineral substrate contributing to rock and mineral decay which manifests itself as bio weathering of rock surfaces given their characteristic slow and sensitive growth sab may also serve as bioindicators of atmospheric and or climate change
microtubule assembly dynamics new insights at the nanoscale ||||| although the dynamic self assembly behavior of microtubule ends has been well characterized at the spatial resolution of light microscopy nm the single molecule events that lead to these dynamics are less clear recently a number of in vitro studies used novel approaches combining laser tweezers microfabricated chambers and high resolution tracking of microtubule bound beads to characterize mechanochemical aspects of mt dynamics at nanometer scale resolution in addition computational modeling is providing a framework for integrating these experimental results into physically plausible models of molecular scale microtubule dynamics these nanoscale studies are providing new fundamental insights about microtubule assembly and will be important for advancing our understanding of how microtubule dynamic instability is regulated in vivo via microtubule associated proteins therapeutic agents and mechanical forces

under and over water halves of gyrinidae beetle eyes harbor different corneal nanocoatings providing adaptation to the water and air environments ||||| whirligig beetles gyrinidae inhabit water surfaces and possess unique eyes which are split into the overwater and underwater parts in this study we analyze the micro and nanostructure of the split eyes of two gyrinidae beetles genera gyrinus and orectochilus we find that corneae of the overwater ommatidia are covered with maze like nanostructures while the corneal surface of the underwater eyes is smooth we further show that the overwater nanostructures possess no anti wetting but the anti reflective properties with the spectral preference in the range of nm these findings illustrate the adaptation of the corneal nanocoating of the two halves of an insect s eye to two different environments the novel natural anti reflective nanocoating we describe may find future technological applications
new functional insights into the internal architecture of the laminated anchor spicules of euplectella aspergillum ||||| significance the remarkable properties of biological structural materials can often be attributed to the composite arrangement of their constituents this paper focuses on the high aspect ratio load bearing glassy skeletal fibers spicules of the marine sponge euplectella aspergillum considering that the spicules internal architecture cannot be repaired or remodeled we hypothesize that there is a connection between their internal structure and their strength using a newly developed structural mechanics model for composite beams we demonstrate that the unique internal geometry that maximizes a beam s strength correlates well with the geometry observed in the native spicules this bio inspired design strategy for increasing a beam s strength has implications for a new generation of man made structural materials to adapt to a wide range of physically demanding environmental conditions biological systems have evolved a diverse variety of robust skeletal architectures one such example euplectella aspergillum is a sediment dwelling marine sponge that is anchored into the sea floor by a flexible holdfast apparatus consisting of thousands of anchor spicules long hair like glassy fibers each spicule is covered with recurved barbs and has an internal architecture consisting of a solid core of silica surrounded by an assembly of coaxial silica cylinders each of which is separated by a thin organic layer the thickness of each silica cylinder progressively decreases from the spicule s core to its periphery which we hypothesize is an adaptation for redistributing internal stresses thus increasing the overall strength of each spicule to evaluate this hypothesis we created a spicule structural mechanics model in which we fixed the radii of the silica cylinders such that the force transmitted from the surface barbs to the remainder of the skeletal system was maximized compared with measurements of these parameters in the native sponge spicules our modeling results correlate remarkably well highlighting the beneficial nature of this elastically heterogeneous lamellar design strategy the structural principles obtained from this study thus provide potential design insights for the fabrication of high strength beams for load bearing applications through the modification of their internal architecture rather than their external geometry

pinna temperature in exercising jackrabbits lepus californicus ||||| pinna surface temperatures of lepus californicus were examined radiographically before and after forced exercise e g running at about km h for min in an outdoor enclosure air temperatures were from to degc and radiant sky temperatures were from to degc in resting animals average pinna surface temperature was only to degc above air temperature and pinna arteries were not evident radiographically immediately after exercise average pinna temperature was often near degc and pinna arteries were evident indicating vasodilation cooling of the pinnae to resting temperatures after exercise generally took to min calculations indicate that the pinnae can dissipate most of the excess metabolic heat generated during the exercise examined and it is suggested that the role of the pinnae as dissipators of exercise induced heat loads should be considered as a factor in the evolution of pinna size
aerodynamics of saccate pollen and its implications for wind pollination ||||| pollen grains of many wind pollinated plants contain air filled bladders or sacci sacci are thought to help orient the pollen grain in the pollination droplet sacci also increase surface area of the pollen grain yet add minimal mass thereby increasing dispersal distance however this aerodynamic hypothesis has not been tested in a published study using scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy mathematical modeling and the saccate pollen of three extant conifers with structurally different pollen grains pinus falcatifolium dacrydium we developed a computational model to investigate pollen flight the model calculates terminal settling velocity based on structural characters of the pollen grain including lengths widths and depths of the main body and sacci angle of saccus rotation and thicknesses of the saccus wall endoreticulations intine and exine the settling speeds predicted by the model were empirically validated by stroboscopic photography this study is the first to quantitatively demonstrate the adaptive significance of sacci for the aerodynamics of wind pollination modeling pollen both with and without sacci indicated that sacci can reduce pollen settling speeds thereby increasing dispersal distance with the exception of pollen grains having robust endoreticulations and those with thick saccus walls furthermore because the mathematical model is based on structural characters and error propagation methods show that the model yields valid results when sample sizes are small the flight dynamics of fossil pollen can be investigated several fossils were studied including bisaccate pinus pteruchus caytonanthus monosaccate gothania and nonsaccate monoletes pollen types
proteinaceous adhesive secretions from insects and in particular the egg attachment glue of opodiphthera sp moths ||||| biochemical and electrophoretic screening of adhesive secretions from australian insects identified six types that appeared to consist largely of protein most were involved in terrestrial egg attachment hydrogel glues were subjected to gravimetric analyses and assessed for overall amino acid composition when proteins in glues from eight insect species were analyzed individually many proved to be rich in gly ser and or pro and some contained substantial levels of hydroxyproline a few proteins were heavily glycosylated abundant protein based secretions were tested as adhesives mainly by measuring dry shear strength on wood the strongest mpa was an egg attachment glue produced by saturniid gum moths of the genus opodiphthera it was harvested from female colleterial gland reservoirs as a treacle like liquid that underwent irreversible gelation and recovered from the capsules of laid eggs as a highly elastic orange brown hydrogel that could also display high tack its protein based nature was confirmed and explored by spectroscopy enzymatic degradation and d gel electrophoresis its proteins are mostly kda and sequences almost all novel were established for tryptic peptides scanning probe microscopy of opodiphthera hydrogel in water returned median values of nn for adhesion kpa for modulus and for resilience recombinant mimics of this material might be useful as biodegradable commodity adhesives or as specialty biomedical products
resisting antimicrobial resistance lessons from fungus farming ants ||||| attine ants use antimicrobials produced by commensal bacteria to inhibit parasites on their fungal gardens however in this agricultural system antimicrobial use does not lead to overwhelming resistance as is typical in clinical settings mixtures of continually evolving antimicrobial variants could support these dynamics
carotenoids need structural colours to shine ||||| the bright colours of feathers are among the most striking displays in nature and are frequently used as sexual signals feathers can be coloured by pigments or by ordered tissue and these mechanisms have traditionally been treated as distinct modes of display here we show that some yellow plumage colour is created both by reflection of light from white structural tissue and absorption of light by carotenoids thus structural components of feathers contribute substantially to yellow carotenoid displays but the effect of variation in structural components on variation in colour displays is to our knowledge unstudied the presence of structural colour in some carotenoid based colour displays will have to be considered in studies of colour signalling
ultrastructural basis and developmental control of blue iridescence in selaginella leaves ||||| 
orange lemon scented beetles opposite enantiomers of limonene as major constituents in the defensive secretion of related carabids ||||| the major constituent in the pygidial gland defensive fluid of the carabid beetle ardistomis schaumii is r limonene whereas that of semiardistomis puncticollis is s limonene this was an unanticipated result since it is not very common to find the opposite enantiomers of the same compound among the secondary metabolites of related species moreover the glandular liquid of a schaumii contains cineole and that of s puncticollis has b pinene b phellandrene sabinene and p cymene of about carabid species that have been chemically investigated this is the first report of the presence of such complex mixtures of monoterpenes in their defensive secretions
biomineralization of gold biofilms on bacterioform gold ||||| bacterial biofilms are associated with secondary gold grains from two sites in australia s ribosomal dna clones of the genus ralstonia that bear similarity to the bacterium ralstonia metallidurans shown to precipitate gold from aqueous gold iii tetrachloride were present on all dna positive gold grains but were not detected in the surrounding soils these results provide evidence for the bacterial contribution to the authigenic formation of secondary bacterioform gold grains and nuggets
renewable fluid dynamic energy derived from aquatic animal locomotion ||||| aquatic animals swimming in isolation and in groups are known to extract energy from the vortices in environmental flows significantly reducing muscle activity required for locomotion a model for the vortex dynamics associated with this phenomenon is developed showing that the energy extraction mechanism can be described by simple criteria governing the kinematics of the vortices relative to the body in the flow in this way we need not make direct appeal to the fluid dynamics which can be more difficult to evaluate than the kinematics examples of these principles as exhibited in swimming fish and existing energy conversion devices are described a benefit of the developed framework is that the potentially infinite dimensional parameter space of the fluid structure interaction is reduced to a maximum of eight combinations of three parameters the model may potentially aid in the design and evaluation of unsteady aero and hydrodynamic energy conversion systems that surpass the betz efficiency limit of steady fluid dynamic energy conversion systems
short amplitude high frequency wing strokes determine the aerodynamics of honeybee flight ||||| most insects are thought to fly by creating a leading edge vortex that remains attached to the wing as it translates through a stroke in the species examined so far stroke amplitude is large and most of the aerodynamic force is produced halfway through a stroke when translation velocities are highest here we demonstrate that honeybees use an alternative strategy hovering with relatively low stroke amplitude approximately degrees and high wingbeat frequency approximately hz when measured on a dynamically scaled robot the kinematics of honeybee wings generate prominent force peaks during the beginning middle and end of each stroke indicating the importance of additional unsteady mechanisms at stroke reversal when challenged to fly in low density heliox bees responded by maintaining nearly constant wingbeat frequency while increasing stroke amplitude by nearly we examined the aerodynamic consequences of this change in wing motion by using artificial kinematic patterns in which amplitude was systematically increased in degrees increments to separate the aerodynamic effects of stroke velocity from those due to amplitude we performed this analysis under both constant frequency and constant velocity conditions the results indicate that unsteady forces during stroke reversal make a large contribution to net upward force during hovering but play a diminished role as the animal increases stroke amplitude and flight power we suggest that the peculiar kinematics of bees may reflect either a specialization for increasing load capacity or a physiological limitation of their flight muscles
a method for characterizing and mimicking forest canopy gaps caused by different disturbances ||||| forest canopy gaps are measurable indicators of past small scale disturbances these disturbances can impact forest stand dynamics in ways that help maintain and enhance many ecosystem values impacts are commonly assessed using timber production metrics based on average stand values but metrics based on smaller scales are needed to assess impacts on nontimber resources in this study we developed a multivariate method of quantitatively characterizing individual canopy gaps in douglas fir grand fir stands in the blue mountains of eastern oregon we then established a reference or target range of variability by profiling gaps according to numbers of snags downed logs gap size and shape and recolonizing vegetation cluster analysis multidimensional scaling and classification trees were used with these profiles to quantify similarity among individual gaps gaps fell into four groups which could be interpreted as three ecologically functional groups on the basis of their role in stand development gaps caused by the same agents commonly fell within the same functional group flooding logging spruce budworm and windfall cause stand level impacts that reset the stand development sequence bark beetles tree fall and root diseases cause within stand impacts that altered the rate of stand development and stem decay and dwarf mistletoe and under some circumstances all disturbance agents could kill trees yet have no impact on stand development except create space into which neighboring trees expand we present a simple test to monitor how gaps change with silvicultural manipulations results indicate that this method offers a way to systematically guide silvicultural manipulations aimed at mimicking natural disturbances at the canopy gap scale and a way to monitor the effectiveness of such silvicultural treatments and management actions using gap based silviculture prescriptions
thermoregulation by kangaroos from mesic and arid habitats influence of temperature on routes of heat loss in eastern grey kangaroos macropus giganteus and red kangaroos macropus rufus ||||| we examined thermoregulation in red kangaroos macropus rufus from deserts and in eastern grey kangaroos macropus giganteus from mesic forests woodlands desert kangaroos have complex evaporative heat loss mechanisms but the relative importance of these mechanisms is unclear little is known of the abilities of grey kangaroos our detailed study of these kangaroos thermoregulatory responses at air temperatures ta from deg to degc showed that while some differences occur their abilities are fundamentally similar both species show the basic marsupial characteristics of relatively low basal metabolism and body temperature tb within the thermoneutral zone tb was documentclass aastex usepackage amsbsy usepackage amsfonts usepackage amssymb usepackage bm usepackage mathrsfs usepackage pifont usepackage stmaryrd usepackage textcomp usepackage portland xspace usepackage amsmath amsxtra usepackage ot ot fontenc newcommand cyr renewcommand rmdefault wncyr renewcommand sfdefault wncyss renewcommand encodingdefault ot normalfont selectfont declaretextfontcommand textcyr cyr pagestyle empty declaremathsizes begin document landscape circ pm circ end document c documentclass aastex usepackage amsbsy usepackage amsfonts usepackage amssymb usepackage bm usepackage mathrsfs usepackage pifont usepackage stmaryrd usepackage textcomp usepackage portland xspace usepackage amsmath amsxtra usepackage ot ot fontenc newcommand cyr renewcommand rmdefault wncyr renewcommand sfdefault wncyss renewcommand encodingdefault ot normalfont selectfont declaretextfontcommand textcyr cyr pagestyle empty declaremathsizes begin document landscape overline x pm mathrm se end document in both species and except for a small rise at ta degc tb was stable over a wide range of ta metabolic heat production was higher in red kangaroos at ta degc at the highest ta degc both species relied on evaporative heat loss ehl to maintain tb both panting and licking were used the eastern grey kangaroo utilised panting of ehl as the principal mode of ehl and while this was so for red kangaroos cutaneous evaporative heat loss cehl was significant of ehl cehl appeared to be mainly licking as evidenced from surface temperatures both species utilised peripheral vascular adjustments to control heat flow as indicated by changes in dry conductance cdry at lower temperatures cdry was minimal but it increased significantly at ta just below tb degc in these conditions the cdry of red kangaroos was significantly higher than that of eastern grey kangaroos indicating a greater reliance on dry heat loss under conditions where heat flows into the body from the environment ta degc there was peripheral vasoconstriction to reduce this inflow cdry decreased significantly from the values seen at degc in both kangaroos the results indicated that while both species have excellent thermoregulatory abilities the desert red kangaroos may cope better with more extreme temperatures given that they respond to ta degc with lower respiratory evaporation than do the eastern grey kangaroos
variability in plant nutrients reduces insect herbivore performance ||||| the performance and population dynamics of insect herbivores depend on the nutritive and defensive traits of their host plants the literature on plant herbivore interactions focuses on plant trait mean values but recent studies showing the importance of plant genetic diversity for herbivores suggest that plant trait variance may be equally important the consequences of plant trait variance for herbivore performance however have been largely overlooked here we report an extensive assessment of the effects of within population plant trait variance on herbivore performance using performance datasets from species of insect herbivores we show that variance in plant nutritive traits substantially reduces mean herbivore performance via non linear averaging of performance relationships that were overwhelmingly concave down by contrast relationships between herbivore performance and plant defence levels were typically linear with variance in plant defence not affecting herbivore performance via non linear averaging our results demonstrate that plants contribute to the suppression of herbivore populations through variable nutrient levels not just by having low average quality as is typically thought we propose that this phenomenon could play a key role in the suppression of herbivore populations in natural systems and that increased nutrient heterogeneity within agricultural crops could contribute to the sustainable control of insect pests in agroecosystems
fish schooling as a basis for vertical axis wind turbine farm design ||||| most wind farms consist of horizontal axis wind turbines hawts due to the high power coefficient mechanical power output divided by the power of the free stream air through the turbine cross sectional area of an isolated turbine however when in close proximity to neighboring turbines hawts suffer from a reduced power coefficient in contrast previous research on vertical axis wind turbines vawts suggests that closely spaced vawts may experience only small decreases or even increases in an individual turbine s power coefficient when placed in close proximity to neighbors thus yielding much higher power outputs for a given area of land a potential flow model of inter vawt interactions is developed to investigate the effect of changes in vawt spatial arrangement on the array performance coefficient which compares the expected average power coefficient of turbines in an array to a spatially isolated turbine a geometric arrangement based on the configuration of shed vortices in the wake of schooling fish is shown to significantly increase the array performance coefficient based upon an array of x wind turbines the results suggest increases in power output of over one order of magnitude for a given area of land as compared to hawts
the role of granules within viscous capture threads of orb weaving spiders ||||| summary sticky viscous prey capture threads form the spiral elements of spider orb webs and are responsible for retaining insects that strike a web these threads are formed of regularly spaced aqueous droplets that surround a pair of supporting axial fibers when a thread is flattened on a microscope slide a small opaque granule can usually be seen within each droplet these granules have been thought to be the glycoprotein glue that imparts thread adhesion both independent contrast and standard regressions showed that granule size is directly related to droplet volume and indicated that granule volume is about of droplet volume we attempted to find support for the hypothesized adhesive role of granules by establishing an association between the contact surface area and volume of these granules and the stickiness of the viscous threads of species in the context of a six variable model that describes thread stickiness however we found that granule size made either an insignificant or a small negative contribution to thread stickiness consequently we hypothesize that granules serve to anchor larger surrounding layers of transparent glycoprotein glue to the axial fibers of the thread thereby equipping droplets to resist slippage on the axial fibers as these droplets generate adhesion elongate under a load and transfer force to the axial fibers
wet mammals shake at tuned frequencies to dry ||||| in cold wet weather mammals face hypothermia if they cannot dry themselves by rapidly oscillating their bodies through a process similar to shivering furry mammals can dry themselves within seconds we use high speed videography and fur particle tracking to characterize the shakes of animals animals species and five dog breeds ranging over four orders of magnitude in mass from mice to bears we here report the power law relationship between shaking frequency f and body mass m to be f m which is close to our prediction of f m based upon the balance of centrifugal and capillary forces we also observe a novel role for loose mammalian dermal tissue by whipping around the body it increases the speed of drops leaving the animal and the ensuing dryness relative to tight dermal tissue
the thermogenic center in social wasps ||||| in the social wasps vespa orientalis and paravespula germanica hymenoptera vespinae a thermogenic center has been found in the dorsal part of the first thoracic segment the temperature in this region of the prothorax is higher by degrees c than that at the tip of the abdomen and this in actively flying hornets outside the nest workers males or queens as well as in hornets inside the nest that attend to the brood in the combs on viewing the region from the outside one discerns a canal or rather a fissure in the cuticle which commences at the center of the dorsal surface of the prothorax and extends till the mesothorax thus the length of this canal or fissure is approximately mm and it is seen to contain numerous thin hairs whose shape varies from that of the hairs alongside the structure beneath the cuticle in this region there are dorsoventral as well as longitudinal muscles in abundance much the same as the musculature in the remaining thoracic segments i e the meso and metathorax which activate the two pairs of wings the canal bearing segment is of course devoid of wings and its dorsoventral muscles are attached to the cuticle which in this region resembles a bowl harboring several layers of epithelium that boasts numerous butterfly shaped tracheal branches additionally there are layers that display lymph filled spaces and also perforated layers and depressions and beneath all these is a lace like layer that also coats the cuticle s hollows underneath the cuticle proper there are numerous large mitochondria and tracheae which occupy a considerable part of the cuticular epithelium surface these abundant mitochondria are most probably the main element of heat production in the thermogenic center
the behavior in flow of the morphologically variable seaweed hedophyllum sessile c ag setchell ||||| drag force was measured on individual specimens of hedophyllum sessile in a variable speed flow tank those from sheltered localities which are broad bullate blades experience greater drag at a given water velocity than ones from localities more exposed to the action of waves which have smooth deeply dissected blades all specimens rearranged their blades as water velocity increased resulting in a decrease in effective drag at higher water speeds but individuals with smooth dissected blades assumed a more compact shape at high current speeds and thus reduced their effective drag over that of broad bladed individuals at the same speed in habitats chronically exposed to strong wave action drag reduction may be an important survival mechanism in calm habitats the turbulence induced by lack of such streamlining may enhance mixing of the water in the immediate vicinity of a plant
differential response to circularly polarized light by the jewel scarab beetle chrysina gloriosa ||||| circularly polarized light is rare in the terrestrial environment and cuticular reflections from scarab beetles are one of the few natural sources chrysina gloriosa leconte a scarab beetle found in montane juniper forests of the extreme southwestern united states and northern mexico are camouflaged in juniper foliage however when viewed with right circularly polarizing filters the beetles exhibit a stark black contrast given the polarization specific changes in the appearance of c gloriosa we hypothesized that c gloriosa can detect circularly polarized light we tested for phototactic response and differential flight orientation of c gloriosa toward different light stimuli chrysina gloriosa exhibited a positive phototaxis b differential flight orientation between linear and circularly polarized light stimuli of equal intensities and c discrimination between circularly polarized and unpolarized lights of different intensities consistent with a model of circular polarization sensitivity based on a quarter wave plate these results demonstrate that c gloriosa beetles respond differentially to circularly polarized light in contrast chrysina woodi horn a close relative with reduced circularly polarized reflection exhibited no phototactic discrimination between linear and circularly polarized light circularly polarized sensitivity may allow c gloriosa to perceive and communicate with conspecifics that remain cryptic to predators reducing indirect costs of communication
peptides controlling stifness of connective tissue in sea cucumbers ||||| we present the first evidence of a system of four bioactive peptides that affect the stiffness of sea cucumber dermis the body wall dermis of sea cucumbers consists of catch connective tissue that is characterized by quick and drastic stiffness changes under nervous control the peptides were isolated from the body wall their amino acid sequences determined and identical peptides synthesized two peptides which we named holokinins are homologous with bradykinin we tested the effect of the peptides on the mechanical properties of sea cucumber dermis both of the holokinins softened the dermis and a pentapeptide that we designated as ngiwyamide stiffened it both effects were reversibly suppressed by anesthesia with menthol we called the fourth peptide stichopin it had no direct effect on the stiffness of the dermis but suppressed action of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine reversibly the results suggest that the peptides are neuropeptides and are part of a sophisticated system of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators that controls the connective tissue stiffness of sea cucumber dermis
root contraction helps protect the living rock cactus ariocarpus fissuratus from lethal high temperatures when growing in rocky soil ||||| unlabelled premise of the study we investigated how the living rock cactus ariocarpus fissuratus like other low growing desert plants can endure potentially lethal high temperatures at the soil surface specifically we examined how shoot descent by root contraction in the presence or absence of soil rocks influences shoot temperatures and transpiration methods root contraction was identified by measuring shoot descent and anatomical analysis temperatures and transpiration were measured for plants at two heights in sandy and rocky soil and temperature tolerances were determined by vital staining key results plants embedded in rocky soil survived an extreme heat episode unlike plants in sandy soil though rocks did not moderate low temperatures root contraction occurred regardless of season and soil moisture xylem conduits wide band tracheids formed a compressible lattice that decreased root length as rays enlarged the root base radially plant position in the soil did not affect transpiration conclusions contractile roots pulled plants of a fissuratus into the soil at rates of mm yr maintaining shoots level with the soil surface kept plant temperatures below the high lethal temperature and improved survivorship in soil shaded by surface rocks
insects did it first a micropatterned adhesive tape for robotic applications ||||| based on the structural and experimental studies of more than insect species from different lineages we have developed and characterized a bioinspired polymer material with the ability of multiple glue free bonding and debonding the material surface is covered with a pattern of microstructures which resembles the geometry of tenent hairs previously described from the feet of flies beetles earwigs and other insects the tape with such a microstructure pattern demonstrates at least two times higher pull off force per unit apparent contact area compared to the flat polymer additionally the tape is less sensitive to contamination by dust particles than a commercially available pressure sensitive adhesive tape even if the insect tape is contaminated it can be washed with a soap solution in water in order to completely recover its adhesive properties we have successfully applied the tape to the g wall climbing robot mini whegs furthermore the tape can be used for multiple adhering of objects to glass surfaces or as a protective tape for sensitive glass surfaces of optical quality another area of potential applications is gripping and manipulation of objects with smooth surfaces
dissecting insect flight ||||| abstract what force does an insect wing generate finding answers to this enduring question is an essential step toward our understanding of interactions of moving objects with fluids that enable most living species such as insects birds and fish to travel efficiently and us to follow similar suit with sails oars and airfoils we give a brief history of research in insect flight and discuss recent findings in unsteady aerodynamics of flapping flight at intermediate range reynolds numbers in particular we examine the unsteady mechanisms in uniform and accelerated motions forward and hovering flight as well as passive flight of free falling objects the results obtained by taking the insects apart helped us to resolve previous puzzles about the force estimates in hovering insects to ellucidate basic mechanisms essential to flapping flight and to gain insights about the efficieny of flight
mechanical design in sea anemones ||||| by applying principles of fluid and solid mechanics to biological structures i have studied the morphological adaptations of two species of sea anemones to the mechanical activities they perform and the environmental forces they encounter the two species of anemones i used represent different extremes in mechanical behavior metridium senile a calm water species noted for the great range of shapes and sizes it can assume batham and pantin and anthopleura xanthogrammica a species occurring in areas exposed to extreme wave action hand dayton i chose anemones because they are simple in structure thus differences in morphology and function between species are easier to recognize and characterize than they would be for more complex animals
lactobacillus fermentum rc inhibits staphylococcus aureus infection of surgical implants in rats ||||| staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of community and hospital acquired infections moreover the clinical impact of s aureus is on the rise because of the global increase in the incidence of multidrug resistant strains and its growing prevalence as a major cause of surgical infections as a result there is a pressing need to identify new antistaphylococcal agents and preventative strategies that will help in the management of these types of infections this report describes the successful use of a probiotic lactobacillus fermentum rc and its secreted biosurfactant to inhibit surgical implant infections caused by s aureus l fermentum rc and its secreted biosurfactant both significantly inhibited s aureus infection and bacteria adherence to surgical implants
unique structural features facilitate lizard tail autotomy ||||| autotomy refers to the voluntary shedding of a body part a renowned example is tail loss among lizards as a response to attempted predation although many aspects of lizard tail autotomy have been studied the detailed morphology and mechanism remains unclear in the present study we showed that tail shedding by the tokay gecko gekko gecko and the associated extracellular matrix ecm rupture were independent of proteolysis instead lizard caudal autotomy relied on biological adhesion facilitated by surface microstructures results based on bio imaging techniques demonstrated that the tail of gekko gecko was pre severed at distinct sites and that its structural integrity depended on the adhesion between these segments
nanoscale design of snake skin for reptation locomotions via friction anisotropy ||||| multi mode scanning probe microscopy is employed to investigate the nanostructure of dermal samples from three types of snakes sophisticated friction modifying nanostructures are described these include an ordered microfibrillar array that can function to achieve mission adaptable friction characteristics significant reduction of adhesive forces in the contact areas caused by the double ridge nanoscale microfibrillar geometry provides ideal conditions for sliding in forward direction with minimum adhesive forces and friction low surface adhesion in these local contact points may reduce local wear and skin contamination by environmental debris the highly asymmetric pawl like profile of the microfibrillar ends with radius of curvature nm induces friction anisotropy in forward backward motions and serves as an effective stopper for backward motion preserving low friction for forward motion the system of continuous micropores penetrating through the snake skin may serve as a delivery system for lubrication anti adhesive lipid mixture that provides for boundary lubrication of snake skins
bromophycolide a targets heme crystallization in the human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum ||||| plasmodium falciparum the most deadly human malaria parasite poses a major threat to human health worldwide with over million clinical cases and between one and two million deaths annually natural products and their synthetic derivatives have provided a significant number of successful antimalarial treatments to date representing approximately of current drugs quinine discovered from cinchona tree bark has been used to treat malaria for centuries and was the primary antimalarial drug until it was replaced by chloroquine a synthetic derivative in the s chloroquine became the mainstay antimalarial until resistant strains began to appear nearly a decade after its introduction artemisinin isolated from the plant artemisia annua used in traditional chinese medicine ushered in a new wave of antimalarials and became the most potent and rapid acting drug available several synthetic artemisinin derivatives have since been developed and artemisinin based combination therapies are currently in use throughout the world to treat this parasitic disease however artemisinin resistant strains have recently been reported and new antiparasitic drugs are urgently needed to combat these strains
anatomically diverse butterfly scales all produce structural colours by coherent scattering ||||| summary the structural colours of butterflies and moths lepidoptera have been attributed to a diversity of physical mechanisms including multilayer interference diffraction bragg scattering tyndall scattering and rayleigh scattering we used fibre optic spectrophotometry transmission electron microscopy tem and d fourier analysis to investigate the physical mechanisms of structural colour production in twelve lepidopteran species from four families representing all of the previously proposed anatomical and optical classes of butterfly nanostructure the d fourier analyses of tems of colour producing butterfly scales document that all species are appropriately nanostructured to produce visible colours by coherent scattering i e differential interference and reinforcement of scattered visible wavelengths previously hypothesized to produce a blue colour by incoherent tyndall scattering the scales of papilio zalmoxis are not appropriately nanostructured for incoherent scattering rather available data indicate that the blue of p zalmoxis is a fluorescent pigmentary colour despite their nanoscale anatomical diversity all structurally coloured butterfly scales share a single fundamental physical color production mechanism coherent scattering recognition of this commonality provides a new perspective on how the nanostructure and optical properties of structurally coloured butterfly scales evolved and diversified among and within lepidopteran clades
the position of lysine controls the catechol mediated surface adhesion and cohesion in underwater mussel adhesion ||||| intensive studies have found that dihydroxyphenylalanine dopa is one of the key molecules for underwater mussel adhesion although basic mechanisms of mussel adhesion have been elucidated little is known about how mussels control the balance between surface adhesion and cohesion which is critical for successful adhesion without peeling and or tearing in this work we focused on lysine lys molecules which are frequently flanked to dopa residues in interfacial adhesive proteins specifically their synergy and anti synergy on surface adhesion and cohesion three model peptides were designed to characterize flanking lys effects through nano mechanistic analyses we found that flanking lys enhanced surface adhesion but disrupted fe mediated cohesion through nuclear magnetic resonance analyses and density functional theory calculations we corroborated the synergetic effect on surface adhesion and anti synergetic effect on cohesion we also confirmed the consistency of flanking lys effects in the actual protein system thus we for the first time discovered that each dopa molecule in interfacial adhesive proteins is participated in surface adhesion and cohesion differently through controlling the existence of flanking lys our discovery enlightens how nature designs adhesive proteins through according roles of dopa
venom kinematics during prey capture in conus the biomechanics of a rapid injection system ||||| summary cone snails use an extensile tubular proboscis as a conduit to deliver a potent cocktail of bioactive venom peptides into their prey previous studies have focused mainly on understanding the venom s role in prey capture but successful prey capture requires both rapid physiological and biomechanical mechanisms conus catus a fish hunting species uses a high speed hydraulic mechanism to inject its hollow spear like radular tooth into prey we take an integrated approach to investigating the biomechanics of this process by coupling kinematic studies with morphological analyses taking advantage of the opaque venom and translucent proboscis of a mollusc hunting juvenile cone snail conus pennaceus we have determined that a high speed prey capture mechanism is not unique to cone species that hunt fish prey two morphological structures were found to play crucial roles in this process a constriction of the lumen near the tip of the proboscis composed of tall epithelial cells densely packed with microfilaments impedes forward movement of the radular tooth prior to its propulsion proximal to the constriction a muscular sphincter was found to regulate venom flow and pressurization in the proboscis in c pennaceus the rapid appearance and flushing of venom within the proboscis during prey capture suggests a mechanism involving the delivery of a discrete quantity of venom the interplay between these elements provides a unique and effective biomechanical injection system for the fast acting cone snail venom peptides
adaptive advantages of cooperative courtship for subordinate male lance tailed manakins ||||| male lance tailed manakins chiroxiphia lanceolata cooperate in complex courtship displays but the dominant alpha partner monopolizes mating opportunities this raises the question of why subordinates betas cooperate three nonexclusive hypotheses explain the adaptive basis of helping behavior by subordinate males cooperation may increase subordinates immediate reproductive success the reproductive success of close relatives or subordinates chances of future reproduction i demonstrated that beta males rarely sired chicks and were unrelated to their alpha partners but received delayed direct benefits from cooperation betas had an increased probability of becoming an alpha when compared to males that had not been betas to investigate the mechanism by which betas attain these adaptive benefits i examined betas success in replacing their alpha partners both in natural turnover events and when alphas were experimentally removed beta males did not consistently inherit alpha roles in the same territories where they served their beta tenure arguing that queuing for status does not fully explain the benefits of cooperation for betas instead betas may be apprenticing to develop effective and appropriate displays that enhance their subsequent success as alphas complex social affiliations appear to mediate selective pressure for cooperation in this species
spider web glue two proteins expressed from opposite strands of the same dna sequence ||||| the various silks that make up the web of the orb web spiders have been studied extensively however success in prey capture depends as much on the web glue as on the fibers spider silk glue which is considered one of the strongest and most effective biological glues is an aqueous solution secreted from the orb weaving spider s aggregate glands and coats the spiral prey capturing threads of their webs studies identified the major component of the glue as microscopic nodules made of a glycoprotein this study describes two newly discovered proteins that form the glue glycoprotein of the golden orb weaving spider nephila clavipes our results demonstrate that both proteins contain unique amino acid repetitive domains that are encoded by opposite strands of the same dna sequence thus the genome of the spider encodes two distinct yet functionally related genes by using both strands of an identical dna sequence moreover the closest match for the nonrepetitive region of one of the proteins is chitin binding proteins the web glue appears to have evolved a substantial level of sophistication matching that of the spider silk fibers
a buckling region in locust hindlegs contains resilin and absorbs energy when jumping or kicking goes wrong ||||| summary if a hindleg of a locust slips during jumping or misses its target during kicking energy generated by the two extensor tibiae muscles is no longer expended in raising the body or striking a target how then is the energy in a jump mj or kick mj dissipated a specialised buckling region found in the proximal hind tibia where the bending moment is high but not present in the other legs buckled and allowed the distal part of the tibia to extend in jumps when a hindleg slipped it bent by a mean of deg at a velocity of deg ms in kicks that failed to contact a target it bent by deg at a velocity of deg ms it also buckled deg at a rate of deg ms when the tibia was prevented from flexing fully about the femur in preparation for both these movements by experimentally buckling this region through deg at velocities of deg ms we showed that one hindleg could store about mj on bending of which mj was dissipated back to the leg on release a band of blue fluorescence was revealed at the buckling region under uv illumination that had the two key signatures of the elastic protein resilin a group of campaniform sensilla mm proximal to the buckling region responded to imposed buckling movements the features of the buckling region show that it can act as a shock absorber as proposed previously when jumping and kicking movements go wrong
polyphosphoprotein containing marine adhesives ||||| protein phosphorylation is an important regulator of both cellular and extracellular events recently protein phosphorylation has also emerged as an important process in biological adhesives during the last decade herbert waite and his group have indeed characterized several polyphosphoproteins from the adhesive secretions of two different marine organisms mussels and tube building worms this suggests the possibility that polyphosphoproteins could be important components of several bioadhesives and may therefore be widely distributed throughout the animal kingdom many amino acids can be targets for phosphorylation but only phosphoserine pser has been detected to date in marine adhesive proteins we investigated whether monoclonal antibodies directed against pser could be used to specifically label polyphosphoproteins in marine adhesives antibodies were applied on histological sections through the foot of the mussel mytilus edulis and through the building organ of the tube worm sabellaria alveolata in both cases anti pser binding was detected in the adhesive glands phenol gland and cement gland respectively however the intensity of the immunolabeling was different between the two species being weak in the former and strong in the latter with the use of these antibodies a new pser rich bioadhesive has been detected in cuvierian tubules the sticky defense organs of sea cucumbers immunoblots and amino acid analyses confirmed the presence of polyphosphoproteins in the adhesive secretion of the cuvierian tubules from three species of sea cucumber these findings bring to three the number of animal groups in which adhesive processes involve polyphosphoproteins and raise interesting questions about the convergent evolution of these adhesives
microbial conversion of selected azo dyes and their breakdown products ||||| four selected azo dyes acid orange acid orange methyl orange and methyl red were completely decolourised in the presence of anaerobic granular sludge while only methyl red was degraded in aerobic conditions using a conventional activated sludge additional experiments with culture broth devoid of cells showed that anaerobic decolourisation of azo dyes was performed by extracellular reducing agents produced by anaerobic bacteria this was further confirmed by abiotic experiments with sulphide and nadh the presence of redox mediators such as riboflavin led to dramatic acceleration of the anaerobic biodecolourisation process the azo dye reduction products were found to be sulphanilic acid and aminoresorcinol for acid orange sulphanilic acid and amino naphthol for acid orange n n dimethyl phenylenediamine and sulphanilic acid for methyl orange and n n dimethyl phenylenediamine and anthranilic acid for methyl red anaerobic toxicity assays showed that the azo dyes were more toxic than their breakdown products aromatic amines except amino naphthol in the presence of activated sludge only anthranilic acid was completely mineralised while sulphanilic acid was persistent aminoresorcinol amino naphthol and n n dimethyl phenylenediamine underwent autooxidation in aerobic conditions yielding coloured polymeric products on the contrary in the presence of granular methanogenic sludge aminoresorcinol amino naphthol and anthranilic acid were quantitatively methanised sulphanilic acid was partially mineralised while n n dimethyl phenylenediamine was only demethylated producing phenylenediamine as an end product
rheum palaestinum desert rhubarb a self irrigating desert plant ||||| the rare plant rheum palaestinum polygonaceae is a perennial hemicryptophyte that grows during the rainy winter in desert mountainous areas in israel and jordan that receive an average annual rainfall of ca mm it produces between one and four large round leaves that are tightly attached to the ground and form large rosettes of up to m these leaves differ markedly from the typical small leaves of most desert plants moreover they have a unique d morphology resembling a scaled down mountainous area with well developed steep drainage systems raising the question which selective agents were involved in their evolution we propose that the large leaves collect rainwater that then infiltrates the soil surrounding the root we measured the seasonal course of leaf growth examined the area of wet soil surrounding the root after actual and simulated rain and modeled the water harvesting capacity using the plant leaf area and the weekly precipitation we show that even in the slightest rains water flows above the veins to the leaf s base where it irrigates the vertical root a typical plant harvests more than cm of water per year and enjoys a water regime of about mm year equivalent to the water supply in a mediterranean climate this is the first example of self irrigation by large leaves in a desert plant creating a leaf made mini oasis
young wallabies get a free ride ||||| wallabies and kangaroos increase their speed of hopping with little increase in their use of metabolic energy apparently by means of elastic energy savings in their hindlimb tendons here we report that because of this storage capacity female tammar wallabies can carry large young in their pouch at very low cost with no increase in metabolic energy expenditure
carbon acquisition by diatoms ||||| diatoms are responsible for up to of primary productivity in the ocean and complete genome sequences are available for two species however there are very significant gaps in our understanding of how diatoms take up and assimilate inorganic c diatom plastids originate from secondary endosymbiosis with a red alga and their form id rubisco ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase from horizontal gene transfer which means that embryophyte paradigms can only give general guidance as to their c acquisition mechanisms although diatom rubiscos have relatively high co affinity and co o selectivity the low diffusion coefficient for co in water has the potential to restrict the rate of photosynthesis diatoms growing in their natural aquatic habitats operate inorganic c concentrating mechanisms ccms which provide a steady state co concentration around rubisco higher than that in the medium how these ccms work is still a matter of debate however it is known that both co and hco are taken up and an obvious but as yet unproven possibility is that active transport of these species across the plasmalemma and or the four membrane plastid envelope is the basis of the ccm in one marine diatom there is evidence of c like biochemistry which could act as or be part of a ccm alternative mechanisms which have not been eliminated include the production of co from hco at low ph maintained by a h pump in a compartment close to that containing rubisco
dynamic fracture resilience of elk antler biomimetic inspiration for improved crashworthiness ||||| the antler of the north american elk has been shown to have impressive fracture resistance under quasi static loads but given its viscoelastic behavior and impact nature of loading questions remain as to its mechanical and in particular fracture behavior under dynamic loading samples were tested using a unique split pressure hopkin son bar sphb for four point bending experiments in order to measure the fracture toughness of this material interestingly the hierarchical structure of antler had a strong influence on crack propagation characteristics and cracks tended to propagate along the osteonal growth direction whether loaded parallel or perpendicular to the osteonal growth direction this occurred to such a degree so as to stop all crack propagation through the sample on transverse specimens thus inhibiting the ability to measure a valid crack initiation toughness and demonstrating the extreme resilience of antler to resist dynamic fracture the high resilience of antler to impact loading may serve as biomimetic inspiration to future material development for crashworthiness and defense applications
light transmission in window leaved plants ||||| window leaved plants are succulent plants which possess areas of clear epidermis on their leaves the underlying water storage tissue is transparent to allow light penetration to the internal chlorenchyma the most highly evolved window leaved plants with the most transparent tissue grow completely underground in desert regions only the rounded leaf tips are level with the soil surface and directly exposed to incident light light transmission curves were measured using live windows of five species of plants from three families liliaceae piperaceae mesembryanthemaceae these results suggest that subterranean window leaves may be limited to a relatively short effective maximum length because of light absorption by the tissues involved scanning electron micrographs sem of these plants show considerable differences in surface structure which may help to modulate incident light comparisons with related mesembryanthemaceae illustrate that a complex series of adaptations have been developed to allow un
the captured launch of a ballistospore ||||| ballistospore discharge is a feature of species of mushrooms basidiomycete yeasts and pathogenic rusts and smuts the biomechanics of discharge may involve an abrupt change in the center of mass associated with the coalescence of buller s drop and the spore however this process occurs so rapidly that the launch of the ballistospore has never been visualized here we report ultra high speed video recordings of the earliest events of spore dispersal using the yeast itersonilia perplexans and the distantly related jelly fungus auricularia auricula images taken at camera speeds of up to frames s demonstrate that ballistospore discharge does involve the coalescence of buller s drop and the spore recordings of i perplexans demonstrate that although coalescence may result from the directed collapse of buller s drop onto the spore it also may involve the movement of the spore toward the drop the release of surface tension at coalescence provides the energy and directional momentum to propel the drop and spore away from the fungus analyses show that ballistospores launch into the air at initial accelerations in excess of g there is no known analog of this micromechanical process in animals plants or bacteria but the recent development of a surface tension motor may mimic the fungal biology described here
growth geometry and mechanics of a blooming lily ||||| despite the common use of the blooming metaphor its floral inspiration remains poorly understood here we study the physical process of blooming in the asiatic lily lilium casablanca our observations show that the edges of the petals wrinkle as the flower opens suggesting that differential growth drives the deployment of these laminar shell like structures we use a combination of surgical manipulations and quantitative measurements to confirm this hypothesis and provide a simple theory for this change in the shape of a doubly curved thin elastic shell subject to differential growth across its planform our experiments and theory overturn previous hypotheses that suggest that blooming is driven by differential growth of the inner layer of the petals and in the midrib by providing a qualitatively different paradigm that highlights the role of edge growth this functional morphology suggests new biomimetic designs for deployable structures using boundary or edge actuation rather than the usual bulk or surface actuation
functional anatomy of the valves in the ambulacral system of sea urchins echinodermata echinoida ||||| summarythe water vascular system of sea urchins is examined with special reference to the valves positioned between the radial vessel and the ampullae of the tube feet the lips of the valve protrude into the ampulla thus the valve functions mainly like a check valve that allows the unidirectional flow of fluid towards the ampulla each ampulla tube foot compartment acts as a semi autonomous hydraulic system the lumina of the ampulla and the tube foot are lined with myoepithelia except for the interconnecting channels that pierce the ambulacral plate the contraction of the ampulla results in an increasing hydraulic pressure that protrudes the tube foot provided that the valve is closed the retraction of the tube foot results in a backflow of fluid independent of the condition of the valve the lips of the valve are folds of the hydrocoel epithelium the pore slit lies in the midline the perradial faces of the lips are covered with the squamous epithelium of the lateral water vessel the ampullar faces are specialized parts of the ampulla myoepithelium turgescent cells which form incompressible cushions take the place of the support cells the valve myocytes run parallel to the pore slit and form processes that run along the base of the ampulla and the perradial channel up to the podial retractor muscle the findings lead to the hypothesis of multiple control of the ampulla tube foot system the mutual activity of the ampulla and the tube foot is indirectly controlled by the lateral and podial nerves which release transmitter substances that diffuse through the connective tissue up to the muscle layers a muscle to muscle conduction causes the simultaneous contraction of the ampulla or the podial retractor muscles the valve muscles are directly controlled by the processes of the valve myocytes which make contact with the podial retractor in extreme conditions a backflow of hydrocoel fluid towards the radial water vessel occurs
the mineralization and hardness of the radular teeth of the limpet patella vulgata l ||||| summarya study of the patella vulgata radula has been made using the scanning electron microscope in its normal and compositional contrast modes of operation the electron microprobe analyser ion etching with argon ions and microhardness testing only iron silicon and small amounts of sulphur were detected in the radula the teeth can be subdivided into a cusp a junctional area where the cusp is joined to the base and the base which is embedded in the radular membrane from a study of longitudinal vertical and transverse sections of the mature teeth it was found that the cusp could be subdivided into a posterior iron rich area fe si and an anterior silicon rich area fe si the junctional zone consisted of a poorly mineralised layer at its border with the cusp and an iron rich layer where it joined the base the upper part of the base fe si could be clearly differentiated from the silicon rich anterior and lower parts of the base fe si no minerals were detected in the membrane the changes in the mineral content of the teeth cusps along the length of the radula were studied iron appeared in the cusps at the th row and the concentration increased to at the th row the iron was here evenly distributed throughout the cusp silicon appeared in the anterior part of the cusp at the th row and as it increased in concentration so the iron was displaced and at the same time the concentration of iron increased in the posterior part of the cusp mineralization appeared to be complete by the th row the teeth cusps appear to consist of a fibres grouped into m thick bundles and the tooth appears to be covered by a thin enamel like layer it is suggested that the fibres contain the silicon rich phase and the matrix the iron rich phase the significance of the arrangement of the fibres and the distribution of the minerals are discussed with relation to the function of the teeth
thermoregulation during flight body temperature and sensible heat transfer in free ranging brazilian free tailed bats tadarida brasiliensis ||||| bat wings are important for thermoregulation but their role in heat balance during flight is largely unknown more than of the energy consumed during flight generates heat as a by product and thus it is expected that bat wings should dissipate large amounts of heat to prevent hyperthermia we measured rectal tr and surface ts temperatures of brazilian free tailed bats tadarida brasiliensis as they emerged from and returned to their daytime roosts and calculated sensible heat transfer for different body regions head body wings and tail membrane bats tr decreased from degc during emergence flights to degc during returns and ts scaled positively with ambient temperature ta total radiative heat loss from bats was significantly greater for a radiative sink to the night sky than for a sink with temperature equal to ta we found that free ranging brazilian free tailed bats on average do not dissipate heat from their wings by convection but instead dissipate radiative heat l to the cloudless night sky during flight w however within the range of ta measured in this study t brasiliensis experienced net heat loss between evening emergence and return flights regional hypothermia reduces heat loss from wings that are exposed to potentially high convective fluxes additional research is needed to establish the role of wings in evaporative cooling during flight in bats
causes and consequences of fluctuating coelomic pressure in sea urchins ||||| we measured coelomic pressure in sea urchins to determine whether it was high enough to support a pneu hypothesis of growth in strongylocentrotus purpuratus the pressure was found to fluctuate rhythmically about a mean of pa and was negative for of the time this is at variance with the theoretically required positive pressures of the pneu hypothesis furthermore there were no sustained significant differences between the pressure patterns of fed and starved urchins presumed to be growing and not growing respectively the rhythmical fluctuations in pressure were caused by movements of the lantern which changed the curvature and tension of the peristomial membrane we developed a mathematical and morphological model relating lantern movements membrane tension and pressure that correctly predicts the magnitude of the fluctuations pressures predicted by the model depend also on coelomic volume changes in lytechinus variegatus simultaneous retraction of the podia which causes expansion of the ampullae resulted in an pa increase in coelomic pressure relative to the pressure during simultaneous podial protraction
a multi enzyme cascade of hemoglobin proteolysis in the intestine of blood feeding hookworms ||||| blood feeding pathogens digest hemoglobin hb as a source of nutrition but little is known about this process in multicellular parasites the intestinal brush border membrane of the canine hookworm ancylostoma caninum contains aspartic proteases apr cysteine proteases cp and metalloproteases mep the first of which is known to digest hb we now show that hb is degraded by a multi enzyme synergistic cascade of proteolysis recombinant apr and cp but not mep digested native hb and denatured globin mep however did cleave globin fragments that had undergone prior digestion by apr and cp proteolytic cleavage sites within the hb a and b chains were determined for the three enzymes identifying a total of cleavage sites by scanning synthetic combinatorial peptide libraries with each enzyme we compared the preferred residues cleaved in the libraries with the known cleavage sites within hb the semi ordered pathway of hb digestion described here is surprisingly similar to that used by plasmodium to digest hb and provides a potential mechanism by which these hemoglobinases are efficacious vaccines in animal models of hookworm infection
chemically mediated antifouling in the red alga delisea pulchra ||||| using laboratory assays we tested whether the secondary metabolites furanones on the surface of the red alga delisea pulchra deter the settlement and growth of a range of ecologically relevant fouling organisms d pulchra and other co occurring seaweeds were almost exclusively fouled by other algae consequently we carried out laboratory assays using propagules from fouling algae ulva sp ceramium sp polysiphonia sp and ectocarpus siliculosis representing the natural fouling community the crude surface extract of d pulchra at the same concentration as on the surface of the plant the furanone fraction of this extract and pure furnaones deterred the settlement of fouling organisms in ecologically relevant assays these data coupled with knowledge of the surface concentration of furanones on d pulchra and a mechanism by which furanones are sequestered onto the surface of the plant provide a rigorous demonstration of chemically mediated antifouling
electrical and behavioral courtship displays in the mormyrid fish brienomyrus brachyistius ||||| summary mormyrid electric fish rely on the waveform of their electric organ discharges eods for communicating species sex and social status while they use the sequences of pulse intervals spis for communicating rapidly changing behavioral states and motivation little is known of electric signaling during courtship behavior because of two major difficulties the fish are not easily bred in captivity and there is no reliable means of separating electric signals from several individuals in natural communication settings through simulating artificial rain conditions we have successfully induced courtship and succeeded in breeding a mormyrid electric fish brienomyrus brachyistius in the laboratory we have also developed a system of video recording and editing combined with cross correlation analysis to precisely record and view behavior and separate eods from two individuals in non breeding and breeding contexts knowing the electrical and motor patterns during courtship allows for further exploration of topics such as mate choice and neural basis of pattern generation in these fish here we describe nine common motor displays and spis analysis of frequency of occurrences suggests that some spi patterns are sex and season specific we also observed electrical duetting called rasp matching during courtship signaling among pairs males and females exchange rasps and bursts respectively in alternation our study employs new techniques to separate and document spis in the context of courtship we show that some spis correlate with specific behavioral acts around the time of spawning
transformation mechanism of amorphous calcium carbonate into calcite in the sea urchin larval spicule ||||| sea urchin larval spicules transform amorphous calcium carbonate acc into calcite single crystals the mechanism of transformation is enigmatic the transforming spicule displays both amorphous and crystalline properties with no defined crystallization front here we use x ray photoelectron emission spectromicroscopy with probing size of nm we resolve distinct mineral phases an initial short lived presumably hydrated acc phase followed by an intermediate transient form of acc and finally the biogenic crystalline calcite phase the amorphous and crystalline phases are juxtaposed often appearing in adjacent sites at a scale of tens of nanometers we propose that the amorphous crystal transformation propagates in a tortuous path through preexisting to nm amorphous units via a secondary nucleation mechanism
spawning events in small and large populations of the green sea urchin strongylocentrotus droebachiensis as recorded using fertilization assays ||||| during the winter and spring of and we used time integrated fertilization assays to monitor sperm availability in three populations of the green sea urchin strongylocentrotus droebachiensis in maine a naturally occurring population of urchins and two smaller groups of transplanted urchins isolated from other aggregations episodes of sperm release coincided in two populations km apart suggesting that urchins were responding to a widespread environmental signal we observed significant lunar periodicity in sperm release events for both of these populations however extensive spawning as shown by fertilization rates near and a dramatic drop in gonad mass only occurred in the large natural population around the onset of thermal stratification and the spring phytoplankton bloom by contrast in the two small populations we observed low fertilization rates and little or no change in gonad mass we speculate that a subset of males in these populations responded to a common external spawning signal but that mass spawning is more likely to occur in large dense populations where sperm concentrations reach high enough levels to trigger spawning in less responsive urchins
radular teeth as models for the improvement of industrial cutting devices ||||| limpets gastropoda and chitons polyplacophora feed on epi and endolithic organisms by means of the radula a specialized feeding apparatus located in the mouth cavity the radula owes most of its abrasive capability to the presence of numerous mineralized teeth here we report on the shape internal structure wearing pattern feeding position and distribution of hardness and elastic properties of these teeth in an attempt to generate ideas for the innovation of industrial cutting devices the teeth remain sharp during their entire working life mainly due to the fact that wearing preferentially occurs along surfaces formed by the internal structure of the tooth it is shown that shape internal structure positioning and material characteristics concertedly function in minimizing the rate at which the teeth wear down and in maintaining optimal cutting behaviour implementation of these self sharpening characteristics into industrial cutting devices is discussed
coral skeletons defend against ultraviolet radiation ||||| background many coral reef organisms are photosynthetic or have evolved in tight symbiosis with photosynthetic symbionts as such the tissues of reef organisms are often exposed to intense solar radiation in clear tropical waters and have adapted to trap and harness photosynthetically active radiation par high levels of ultraviolet radiation uvr associated with sunlight however represent a potential problem in terms of tissue damage methodology principal findings by measuring uvr and par reflectance from intact and ground bare coral skeletons we show that the property of calcium carbonate skeletons to absorb downwelling uvr to a significant extent while reflecting par back to the overlying tissue has biological advantages we placed cnidarians on top of bare skeletons and a uvr reflective substrate and showed that under ambient uvr levels uvr transmitted through the tissues of cnidarians placed on top of bare skeletons were four times lower compared to their counterparts placed on a uvr reflective white substrate in accordance with the lower levels of uvr measured in cnidarians on top of coral skeletons a similar drop in uvr damage to their dna was detected the skeletons emitted absorbed uvr as yellow fluorescence which allows for safe dissipation of the otherwise harmful radiation conclusions significance our study presents a novel defensive role for coral skeletons and reveals that the strong uvr absorbance by the skeleton can contribute to the ability of corals and potentially other calcifiers to thrive under uvr levels that are detrimental to most marine life
signatures of functional constraint at aye aye opsin genes the potential of adaptive color vision in a nocturnal primate ||||| while color vision perception is thought to be adaptively correlated with foraging efficiency for diurnal mammals those that forage exclusively at night may not need color vision nor have the capacity for it indeed although the basic condition for mammals is dichromacy diverse nocturnal mammals have only monochromatic vision resulting from functional loss of the short wavelength sensitive opsin gene however many nocturnal primates maintain intact two opsin genes and thus have dichromatic capacity the evolutionary significance of this surprising observation has not yet been elucidated we used a molecular population genetics approach to test evolutionary hypotheses for the two intact opsin genes of the fully nocturnal aye aye daubentonia madagascariensis a highly unusual and endangered madagascar primate no evidence of gene degradation in either opsin gene was observed for any of aye aye individuals examined furthermore levels of nucleotide diversity for opsin gene functional sites were lower than those for neutrally evolving intergenic regions kb in total which is consistent with a history of purifying selection on aye aye opsin genes the most likely explanation for these findings is that dichromacy is advantageous for aye ayes despite their nocturnal activity pattern we speculate that dichromatic nocturnal primates may be able to perceive color while foraging under moonlight conditions and suggest that behavioral and ecological comparisons among dichromatic and monochromatic nocturnal primates will help to elucidate the specific activities for which color vision perception is advantageous
giant bent core mesogens in the thread forming process of marine mussels ||||| in marine mussels mytilus byssal threads are made in minutes from prefabricated smectic polymer liquid crystals by a process resembling reaction injection molding the mesogens in these arrays are known to be natural block copolymers with rodlike collagen cores using atomic force microscopy it was shown that these collagenous mesogens are bent core or banana shaped in a manner that is consistent with and predictable from their amino acid sequence the overall bend angle in precol ng in mytilus galloprovincialis is about degrees the mesogens have a center to center separation of approximately nm and a length of nm it is evident that the smectic structure of the prefabricated mesophases remains largely intact over microm distances in the molded fibers and is presumably locked in place during molding by cross linking like the smectic liquid crystals of many synthetic banana mesogens the collagenous mesogens of the byssal threads exhibit smc symmetry with a characteristic tilt of degrees at about extension this tilt is considerably reduced and the globular end domains are no longer visible presumably because they have been unraveled
sticking ability in spix s disk winged bat thyroptera tricolor microchiroptera thyropteridae ||||| roosting spix s disk winged bats thyroptera tricolor use disks on their wrists and ankles to cling to smooth leaves in trials we tested the ability of t tricolor and other bats lacking disks trials with species from three families to adhere to i medium grade sandpaper ii lexan polycarbonate iii solid sheet aluminum and iv porous sheet aluminum while t tricolor readily adhered to smooth surfaces the other species did not thyroptera tricolor did not show the same ability to adhere to rough surfaces as the other species that were tested as was demonstrated by their performance on porous aluminum and sandpaper the disks of t tricolor worked by suction and sometimes by wet adhesion in the course of adapting to adhere to smooth surfaces t tricolor appear to have lost some ability to roost on rough ones although one adult t tricolor climbed on a screen covering the inside walls of the polycarbonate cage by interlocking its thumb claws with the surface
mutualism as reciprocal exploitation african plant ants defend foliar but not reproductive structures ||||| the foundation of many plant ant mutualisms is ant protection of plants from herbivores in exchange for food and or shelter while the role of symbiotic ants in protecting plants from stem and leaf feeding herbivores has been intensively studied the relationship between ant defense and measures of plant fitness has seldom been quantified we studied ant aggression damage by herbivores and seed predators and fruit production among acacia drepanolobium trees occupied by four different acacia ant species in an east african savanna levels of ant aggression in response to experimental disturbance differed strongly among the four species all four ant species recruited more strongly to new leaf growth on host plants following disturbance while recruitment to developing fruits was on average an order of magnitude lower host plants occupied by more aggressive ant species suffered significantly less vegetative damage from leaf feeding insects stem boring beetles and vertebrate browsers than host plants occupied by less aggressive ant species however there were no differences among fruiting host plants occupied by different ant species in levels of seed predation by bruchid seed predators fruit production on host trees was significantly correlated with tree stem diameter but not with the identity of resident ants our results demonstrate that defense of host plants may differ substantially among ant species and between vegetative and reproductive structures and that fruit production is not necessarily correlated with high levels of aggression by resident ants
coordinated ventilation and spiracle activity produce unidirectional airflow in the hissing cockroach gromphadorhina portentosa ||||| summary insects exchange respiratory gases via an extensive network of tracheal vessels that open to the surface of the body through spiracular valves although gas exchange is known to increase with the opening of these spiracles it is not clear how this event relates to gas flow through the tracheal system we examined the relationship between respiratory airflow and spiracle activity in a ventilating insect the hissing cockroach gromphadorhina portentosa to better understand the complexity of insect respiratory function using simultaneous video recordings of multiple spiracular valves we found that abdominal spiracles open and close in unison during periods of ventilation additionally independent recordings of co release from the abdominal and thoracic regions and observations of hyperoxic tracer gas movement indicate that air is drawn into the thoracic spiracles and expelled from the abdominal spiracles our video recordings suggest that this unidirectional flow is driven by abdominal contractions that occur when the abdominal spiracles open the spiracles then close as the abdomen relaxes and fills with air from the thorax therefore the respiratory system of the hissing cockroach functions as a unidirectional pump through the coordinated action of the spiracles and abdominal musculature this mechanism may be employed by a broad diversity of large insects that respire by active ventilation
temperatures of desert plants another perspective on the adaptability of leaf size ||||| surface temperatures of perennial plants in the sonoran desert of california ranged from c above air temperature to over c below air temperature during rapid growth periods following rain desert cactus with large photosynthetic stem surfaces had the highest temperatures and lowest transpiration rates perennial plants with relatively small leaves had moderate transpiration rates and leaf temperatures close to air temperature desert perennials with relatively large leaves had leaf temperatures well below air temperature along with the greatest accompanying transpiration rates of over micrograms per square centimeter per second but also had correspondingly low temperatures for maximum photosynthesis the low leaf temperatures measured for these large leafed species are an exception to the more common pattern for desert plants whereby a smaller leaf size prevents overheating and leads to reductions in transpiration and increased water use efficiency the contribution of a larger leaf size to a lower leaf temperature and thus higher rate of photosynthesis for these large leafed species may represent an adaptive pattern previously unrecognized for desert plants
do anemonefishes use molecular mimicry to avoid being stung by host anemones ||||| anemonefishes are known to have a protective mucous coat that allows them to contact the tentacles of their host anemone without being stung there are two conflicting hypotheses as to the source and biochemical properties of this mucous coating one hypothesis proposes that anemonefishes acquire anemone substances from their hosts during the behavioral process of acclimation that protect the fish from being stung anemonefishes are considered to use anemone mucus as chemical camouflage or macromolecular mimicry to avoid recognition as not self by the anemone and possible subsequent stinging another hypothesis is that anemonefishes produce their own protective mucus coat which lacks substances that elicit cnida nematocyst and spirocyst discharge by their hosts the present study used immunological techniques to test whether the anemonefish amphiprion clarkii bennett which was innately protected from two of the anemones used in the present study has a mucous coat that resembles the external mucus of anemones polyclonal antibodies were prepared to the mucus of four species of anemones heteractis crispa ehrenberg stichodactyla haddoni saville kent macrodactyla doreenensis quoy and gaimard and condylactis gigantea weinland ouchterlony double immunodiffusion tests showed that different antigens were present in the mucus of the four anemone species anemone antigens were not detected in the mucous coating of either naive fish that had never before encountered sea anemones or associated those living with sea anemones anemonefishes in ouchterlony tests however more sensitive elisa enzyme linked immunosorbent assay tests showed that anemone mucus antigens were present in the mucous coating of associated anemonefish but not naive fish this showed that an innately protected a clarkii does not produce a mucus coat that is biochemically similar to that of anemones but that the same fish does acquire anemone substances in its mucus coat when it associates with anemones in aquaria it remains to be shown whether these anemone substances actually provide the initial protection for those anemonefishes that must undergo acclimation behavior in order to keep from being stung by their host sea anemones or additional protection for innately protected fishes
mechanical properties and structure of strombus gigas tridacna gigas and haliotis rufescens sea shells a comparative study ||||| sea shells are composed of calcium carbonate crystals interleaved with layers of viscoelastic proteins having dense tailored structures that yield excellent mechanical properties shells such as conch strombus gigas giant clam tridacna gigas and red abalone haliotis rufescens have hierarchical architectures that differ depending on growth requirements and shell formation of the particular mollusk mechanical tests have been carried out on these shells for a comparison of strength with respect to the microstructural architecture and sample orientation the mechanical response is found to vary significantly from specimen to specimen and requires the application of weibull statistics in order to be quantitatively evaluated the complex micro laminate structure of these biocomposite materials is characterized and related to their mechanical properties the red abalone has the highest compressive mpa and flexure strengths of the three shells the giant clam has the lowest strength mpa and the conch has an intermediate value mpa in compression the high compressive strength observed in the abalone is attributed to an optimization of microstructural architecture in the form of d laminates enhancing the fracture toughness of this shell material and enabling higher stresses to develop before fracture d elsevier b v all rights reserved
the function of resilin in beetle wings ||||| this account shows the distribution of elastic elements in hind wings in the scarabaeid pachnoda marginata and coccinellid coccinella septempunctata both coleoptera occurrence of resilin a rubber like protein in some mobile joints together with data on wing unfolding and flight kinematics suggest that resilin in the beetle wing has multiple functions first the distribution pattern of resilin in the wing correlates with the particular folding pattern of the wing second our data show that resilin occurs at the places where extra elasticity is needed for example in wing folds to prevent material damage during repeated folding and unfolding third resilin provides the wing with elasticity in order to be deformable by aerodynamic forces this may result in elastic energy storage in the wing
scorpion toxins modify phytopathogenic fungus physiology a possible source of new fungicides ||||| seven toxins f f were purified from tityus discrepans scorpion venom on a c hplc column the compounds were fungitoxic on macrophomina phaseolina the molecular masses of f f were da and respectively it is not known if f is a small peptide or some other kind of organic molecule compounds f f were peptides the most potent was f with a minimal inhibition concentration of mg ml and a concentration for inhibition of mg ml fungal esterase activity was abolished by f f and f and inhibited by and by f f f and f respectively f f f and f induced an increase on hyphae chitin wall and septum thickness peptides f f induced efflux of the fluorescent dye na corona red complex from hyphae only f and f were inhibited by the prokaryote sodium channel blockers amiloride and mibefradil gas chromatography mass spectrometry analysis suggested that f f f and f altered sterol biosynthesis either by inhibiting ergosterol biosynthesis or by producing ergosterol analogues the peptides affect m phaseolina viability by three mechanisms decreasing esterase activity altering na membrane permeability and altering wall sterol biosynthesis it seems that interfering with sterol synthesis is an important mechanism behind the effect of the fungicideal toxins however the antifungal effects at short times are indicative of a direct esterase inhibition which with the increased membrane leakiness to na makes the fungus inviable
gamma aminobutyrate defense against invertebrate pests ||||| gamma aminobutyrate gaba is a ubiquitous four carbon non protein amino acid in plants stress induced gaba accumulation is well documented however the role s of gaba accumulation is contentious in this opinion article we argue that wounding due to herbivory and crawling by insect larvae causes rapid gaba accumulation via the disruption of cellular compartmentation and the release of the acidic vacuolar contents to the cytosol the activity of glutamate decarboxylase the cytosolic enzyme responsible for gaba synthesis has an acidic ph optimum subsequent gaba ingestion has a plant defense function by directly acting on gaba regulated invertebrate neuromuscular junctions plants with an enhanced gaba producing capacity reduce herbivory by invertebrate pests these findings suggest that gaba accumulation is a rapidly deployed local resistance mechanism that constitutes a first line of defense in deterring herbivory
nanopatterned protein microrings from a diatom that direct silica morphogenesis ||||| diatoms are eukaryotic microalgae that produce species specifically structured cell walls made of sio silica formation of the intricate silica structures of diatoms is regarded as a paradigm for biomolecule controlled self assembly of three dimensional nano to microscale patterned inorganic materials silica formation involves long chain polyamines and phosphoproteins silaffins and silacidins which are readily soluble in water and spontaneously form dynamic supramolecular assemblies that accelerate silica deposition and influence silica morphogenesis in vitro however synthesis of diatom like silica structure in vitro has not yet been accomplished indicating that additional components are required here we describe the discovery and intracellular location of six novel proteins cingulins that are integral components of a silica forming organic matrix microrings in the diatom thalassiosira pseudonana the cingulin containing microrings are specifically associated with girdle bands which constitute a substantial part of diatom biosilica remarkably the microrings exhibit protein based nanopatterns that closely resemble characteristic features of the girdle band silica nanopatterns upon the addition of silicic acid the microrings become rapidly mineralized in vitro generating nanopatterned silica replicas of the microring structures a silica forming organic matrix with characteristic nanopatterns was also discovered in the diatom coscinodiscus wailesii which suggests that preassembled protein based templates might be general components of the cellular machinery for silica morphogenesis in diatoms these data provide fundamentally new insight into the molecular mechanisms of biological silica morphogenesis and may lead to the development of self assembled d mineral forming protein scaffolds with designed nanopatterns for a host of applications in nanotechnology
artificial photosynthesis water cleavage into hydrogen and oxygen by visible light ||||| 
regulation of water absorption in the frog skins by two vasotocin dependent water channel aquaporins aqp h and aqp h ||||| a new frog aquaporin aqp cdna was cloned from a cdna library constructed from the ventral skin of the tree frog hyla japonica this aqp hyla aqp h consisted of amino acid residues with a high homology to mammalian aqp the predicted amino acid sequence contained the two conserved asn pro ala motifs found in all the major intrinsic protein family members and the putative six transmembrane domains the sequence also contained a mercurial compound cysteine one potential n glycosylation site at asn and a putative phosphorylation site recognized by protein kinase a at ser in a swelling assay using xenopus oocytes aqp h facilitated water permeability especially in response to camp expression of aqp h mrna was restricted to several tissues including the ventral skin kidney and urinary bladder but with immunofluorescence staining using an antipeptide antibody st against the aqp h protein immunopositive cells were found only in the ventral skin and urinary bladder in the ventral pelvic skin the label for aqp h was localized in the entire plasma membrane of the granular cells beneath the outmost layer of the skin and in the basolateral membrane of the granular cells in this layer in response to vasotocin however the label for aqp h became more intense in the apical membrane in the granular cells of the outermost layer similar to the case for the earlier studied aqp h which was specifically expressed in the ventral skin taken together these findings suggest that not only aqp h but also aqp h acts as a regulator of the water balance in this frog
energy and time optimal trajectories in exploratory jumps of the spider phidippus regius ||||| jumping spiders are proficient jumpers that use jumps in a variety of behavioural contexts we use high speed high resolution video to measure the kinematics of a single regal jumping spider for a total of different tasks based on a horizontal gap of body lengths and vertical gap of body lengths for short range jumps we show that low angled trajectories are used that minimise flight time for longer jumps take off angles are steeper and closer to the optimum for minimum energy cost of transport comparison of jump performance against other arthropods shows that phidippus regius is firmly in the group of animals that use dynamic muscle contraction for actuation as opposed to a stored energy catapult system we find that the jump power requirements can be met from the estimated mass of leg muscle hydraulic augmentation may be present but appears not to be energetically essential
reconstruction and regulation of the central catabolic pathway in the thermophilic propionate oxidizing syntroph pelotomaculum thermopropionicum ||||| abstract obligate anaerobic bacteria fermenting volatile fatty acids in syntrophic association with methanogenic archaea share the intermediate bottleneck step in organic matter decomposition these organisms called syntrophs are biologically significant in terms of their growth at the thermodynamic limit and are considered to be the ideal model to address bioenergetic concepts we conducted genomic and proteomic analyses of the thermophilic propionate oxidizing syntroph pelotomaculum thermopropionicum to obtain the genetic basis for its central catabolic pathway draft sequencing and subsequent targeted gap closing identified all genes necessary for reconstructing its propionate oxidizing pathway i e methylmalonyl coenzyme a pathway characteristics of this pathway include the following i the initial two steps are linked to later steps via transferases ii each of the last three steps can be catalyzed by two different types of enzymes it was also revealed that many genes for the propionate oxidizing pathway except for those for propionate coenzyme a transferase and succinate dehydrogenase were present in an operon like cluster and accompanied by multiple promoter sequences and a putative gene for a transcriptional regulator proteomic analysis showed that enzymes in this pathway were up regulated when grown on propionate of these enzymes regulation of fumarase was the most stringent we discuss this tendency of expression regulation based on the genetic organization of the open reading frame cluster results suggest that fumarase is the central metabolic switch controlling the metabolic flow and energy conservation in this syntroph
grass roots chemistry meta tyrosine an herbicidal nonprotein amino acid ||||| fine fescue grasses displace neighboring plants by depositing large quantities of an aqueous phytotoxic root exudate in the soil rhizosphere via activity guided fractionation we have isolated and identified the nonprotein amino acid m tyrosine as the major active component m tyrosine is significantly more phytotoxic than its structural isomers o and p tyrosine we show that m tyrosine exposure results in growth inhibition for a wide range of plant species and propose that the release of this nonprotein amino acid interferes with root development of competing plants acid hydrolysis of total root protein from arabidopsis thaliana showed incorporation of m tyrosine suggesting this as a possible mechanism of phytotoxicity m tyrosine inhibition of a thaliana root growth is counteracted by exogenous addition of protein amino acids with phenylalanine having the most significant effect the discovery of m tyrosine as well as a further understanding of its mode s of action could lead to the development of biorational approaches to weed control

molecular nanosprings in spider capture silk threads ||||| spider capture silk is a natural material that outperforms almost any synthetic material in its combination of strength and elasticity the structure of this remarkable material is still largely unknown because spider silk proteins have not been crystallized capture silk is the sticky spiral in the webs of orb weaving spiders here we are investigating specifically the capture spiral threads from araneus an ecribellate orb weaving spider the major protein of these threads is flagelliform protein a variety of silk fibroin we present models for molecular and supramolecular structures of flagelliform protein derived from amino acid sequences force spectroscopy molecular pulling and stretching of bulk capture web pulling on molecules in capture silk fibres from araneus has revealed rupture peaks due to sacrificial bonds characteristic of other self healing biomaterials the overall force changes are exponential for both capture silk molecules and intact strands of capture silk
damage and fluctuations induce loops in optimal transport networks ||||| leaf venation is a pervasive example of a complex biological network endowing leaves with a transport system and mechanical resilience transport networks optimized for efficiency have been shown to be trees i e loopless however dicotyledon leaf venation has a large number of closed loops which are functional and able to transport fluid in the event of damage to any vein including the primary veins inspired by leaf venation we study two possible reasons for the existence of a high density of loops in transport networks resilience to damage and fluctuations in load in the first case we seek the optimal transport network in the presence of random damage by averaging over damage to each link in the second case we seek the network that optimizes transport when the load is sparsely distributed at any given time most sinks are closed we find that both criteria lead to the presence of loops in the optimum state
plant and lichen colonization in an asbestos mine spontaneous bioattenuation limits air dispersion of fibres ||||| abstract plant and lichen phytosociological studies describe the different dynamic stages of colonization this approach has been applied to the balangero asbestos mine the most important of western europe up to which is a potential source for the air dispersion of carcinogenic fibres vegetation releves and maps have shown that plants and lichens develop spontaneously on the asbestos rich substrates early colonization stages with low covering hyperaccumulators such as thlaspi sylvium and minuartia laricifolia and with thymus alpestris and t cfr humifusus are followed some decades later by mature plant communities which completely cover the asbestos rich debris thereby limiting the dispersion of fibres lichen colonization even when limited to low covering early stages with pioneer crustose species such as scoliciosporum umbrinum and candelariella vitellina and young foliose thalli of xanthoparmelia tinctina is important whenever asbestos veins are exposed on serpentinite blocks and walls plants and lichens can be considered as bioattenuation spontaneous bioremediation agents in ecological recovery
control of calcium carbonate nucleation and crystal growth by soluble matrx of oyster shell ||||| a calcium binding soluble protein extracted from oyster shell suppresses calcium carbonate nucleation and decreases the rate of crystal growth in vitro these findings suggest that soluble matrix may regulate shell growth
biomechanics a pneumo hydrostatic skeleton in land crabs ||||| like their aquatic counterparts terrestrial crabs repeatedly shed their rigid exoskeleton during moulting but in the case of land crabs little water is available to provide a temporary hydrostatic skeleton before the new skeleton hardens and air does not provide the buoyancy necessary to support the animal here we show that whenever its exoskeleton is shed the blackback land crab gecarcinus lateralis relies on an unconventional type of hydrostatic skeleton that uses both gas and liquid a pneumo hydrostat to our knowledge this is the first experimental evidence for a locomotor skeleton that depends on a gas it establishes a new category of hydrostatic skeletal support and possibly a critical adaptation to life on land for the crustacea
architecture and material properties of diatom shells provide effective mechanical protection ||||| diatoms are the major contributors to phytoplankton blooms in lakes and in the sea and hence are central in aquatic ecosystems and the global carbon cycle all free living diatoms differ from other phytoplankton groups in having silicified cell walls in the form of two shells the frustule of manifold shape and intricate architecture whose function and role if any in contributing to the evolutionary success of diatoms is under debate we explored the defence potential of the frustules as armour against predators by measuring their strength real and virtual loading tests using calibrated glass microneedles and finite element analysis were performed on centric and pennate diatom cells here we show that the frustules are remarkably strong by virtue of their architecture and the material properties of the diatom silica we conclude that diatom frustules have evolved as mechanical protection for the cells because exceptional force is required to break them the evolutionary arms race between diatoms and their specialized predators will have had considerable influence in structuring pelagic food webs and biogeochemical cycles
high abrasion resistance with sparse mineralization copper biomineral in worm jaws ||||| biominerals are widely exploited to harden or stiffen tissues in living organisms with calcium silicon and iron based minerals being most common in notable contrast the jaws of the marine bloodworm glycera dibranchiata contain the copper based biomineral atacamite cu oh cl polycrystalline fibers are oriented with the outer contour of the jaw using nanoindentation we show that the mineral has a structural role and enhances hardness and stiffness despite the low degree of mineralization bloodworm jaws exhibit an extraordinary resistance to abrasion significantly exceeding that of vertebrate dentin and approaching that of tooth enamel
ganglion specific splicing of trpv underlies infrared sensation in vampire bats ||||| vampire bats desmodus rotundus are obligate blood feeders that have evolved specialized systems to suit their sanguinary lifestyle chief among such adaptations is the ability to detect infrared radiation as a means of locating hotspots on warm blooded prey among vertebrates only vampire bats boas pythons and pit vipers are capable of detecting infrared radiation in each case infrared signals are detected by trigeminal nerve fibres that innervate specialized pit organs on the animal s face thus vampire bats and snakes have taken thermosensation to the extreme by developing specialized systems for detecting infrared radiation as such these creatures provide a window into the molecular and genetic mechanisms underlying evolutionary tuning of thermoreceptors in a species specific or cell type specific manner previously we have shown that snakes co opt a non heat sensitive channel vertebrate trpa transient receptor potential cation channel a to produce an infrared detector here we show that vampire bats tune a channel that is already heat sensitive trpv by lowering its thermal activation threshold to about degc this is achieved through alternative splicing of trpv transcripts to produce a channel with a truncated carboxy terminal cytoplasmic domain these splicing events occur exclusively in trigeminal ganglia and not in dorsal root ganglia thereby maintaining a role for trpv as a detector of noxious heat in somatic afferents this reflects a unique organization of the bat trpv gene that we show to be characteristic of laurasiatheria mammals cows dogs and moles supporting a close phylogenetic relationship with bats these findings reveal a novel molecular mechanism for physiological tuning of thermosensory nerve fibres
obligate oil degrading marine bacteria ||||| over the past few years a new and ecophysiologically unusual group of marine hydrocarbon degrading bacteria the obligate hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria ohcb has been recognized and shown to play a significant role in the biological removal of petroleum hydrocarbons from polluted marine waters the introduction of oil or oil constituents into seawater leads to successive blooms of a relatively limited number of indigenous marine bacterial genera alcanivorax marinobacter thallassolituus cycloclasticus oleispira and a few others the ohcb which are present at low or undetectable levels before the polluting event the types of ohcb that bloom depend on the latitude temperature salinity redox and other prevailing physical chemical factors these blooms result in the rapid degradation of many oil constituents a process that can be accelerated further by supplementation with limiting nutrients genome sequencing and functional genomic analysis of alcanivorax borkumensis the paradigm of ohcb has provided significant insights into the genomic basis of the efficiency and versatility of its hydrocarbon utilization the metabolic routes underlying its special hydrocarbon diet and its ecological success these and other studies have revealed the potential of ohcb for multiple biotechnological applications that include not only oil pollution mitigation but also biopolymer production and biocatalysis
inhibiting bacterial cooperation is an evolutionarily robust anti biofilm strategy ||||| bacteria commonly form dense biofilms encased in extracellular polymeric substances eps biofilms are often extremely tolerant to antimicrobials but their reliance on shared eps may also be a weakness as social evolution theory predicts that inhibiting shared traits can select against resistance here we show that eps of salmonella biofilms is a cooperative trait whose benefit is shared among cells and that eps inhibition reduces both cell attachment and antimicrobial tolerance we then compare an eps inhibitor to conventional antimicrobials in an evolutionary experiment while resistance against conventional antimicrobials rapidly evolves we see no evolution of resistance to eps inhibition we further show that a resistant strain is outcompeted by a susceptible strain under eps inhibitor treatment explaining why resistance does not evolve our work suggests that targeting cooperative traits is a viable solution to the problem of antimicrobial resistance bacterial biofilms rely on shared extracellular polymeric substances eps and are often highly tolerant to antibiotics here the authors show in in vitro experiments that salmonella does not evolve resistance to eps inhibition because such strains are outcompeted by a susceptible strain under inhibitor treatment
iridescence a functional perspective ||||| in animals iridescence is generated by the interaction of light with biological tissues that are nanostructured to produce thin films or diffraction gratings uniquely among animal visual signals the study of iridescent coloration contributes to biological and physical sciences by enhancing our understanding of the evolution of communication strategies and by providing insights into physical optics and inspiring biomimetic technologies useful to humans iridescent colours are found in a broad diversity of animal taxa ranging from diminutive marine copepods to terrestrial insects and birds iridescent coloration has received a surge of research interest of late and studies have focused on both characterizing the nanostructures responsible for producing iridescence and identifying the behavioural functions of iridescent colours in this paper we begin with a brief description of colour production mechanisms in animals and provide a general overview of the taxonomic distribution of iridescent colours we then highlight unique properties of iridescent signals and review the proposed functions of iridescent coloration focusing in particular on the ways in which iridescent colours allow animals to communicate with conspecifics and avoid predators we conclude with a brief overview of non communicative functions of iridescence in animals despite the vast amount of recent work on animal iridescence our review reveals that many proposed functions of iridescent coloration remain virtually unexplored and this area is clearly ripe for future research
macroevolutionary assembly of ant plant symbioses pseudomyrmex ants and their ant housing plants in the neotropics ||||| symbioses include some of the clearest cases of coevolution but their origin loss or reassembly with different partners can rarely be inferred here we use ant plant symbioses involving three plant clades to investigate the evolution of symbioses we generated phylogenies for the big eyed arboreal ants pseudomyrmecinae including of their species as well as for five of their plant host groups in each case sampling more than of the species we show that the ant housing vachellia mimosoideae clade and its ants co diversified for the past ma with some species additionally colonized by younger plant nesting ant species some parasitic an apparent co radiation of ants and tachigali caesalpinioideae was followed by waves of colonization by the same ant clade and subsequent occupation by a younger ant group wide crown and stem age differences between the ant housing genus triplaris polygonaceae and its obligate ant inhabitants and stochastic trait mapping indicate that its domatium evolved earlier than the ants now occupying it suggesting previous symbioses that dissolved parasitic ant species evolved from generalists not from mutualists and are younger than the mutualistic systems they parasitize our study illuminates the macroevolutionary assembly of ant plant symbioses which has been highly dynamic even in very specialized systems
solar powered ventilation of african termite mounds ||||| abstract how termite mounds function to facilitate climate control is still only partially understood recent experimental evidence in the mounds of a single species the south asian termite odontotermes obesus suggests that the daily oscillations of radiant heating associated with diurnal insolation patterns drive convective flow within them how general this mechanism is remains unknown to probe this we consider the mounds of the african termite macrotermes michaelseni which thrives in a very different environment by directly measuring air velocities and temperatures within the mound we see that the overall mechanisms and patterns involved are similar to that in the south asian species however there are also some notable differences between the physiology of these mounds associated with the temporal variations in radiant heating patterns and co dynamics because of the difference between direct radiant heating driven by the position of the sun in african conditions and the more shaded south asian environments we see changes in the convective flows in the two types of mounds furthermore we also see that the south asian mounds show a significant overturning of stratified gases once a day while the african mounds have a relatively uniform concentration of co overall our observations show that despite these differences termite architectures can harness periodic solar heating to drive ventilation inside them in very different environments functioning as an external lung with clear implications for human engineering highlighted article termite mounds harness oscillatory solar heating to drive internal ventilation of metabolic gases functioning as an external lung for the colony this passive mechanism has clear implications for human engineering
preformed and induced chemical resistance of tea leaf against exobasidium vexans infection ||||| levels of epicatechin in tea cultivars resistant to blister blight leaf disease were significantly higher than those in susceptible cultivars while the reverse was true for epigallocatechin gallate suggesting that epicatechin was involved in the resistance mechanism the content of the methylxanthines caffeine and theobromine in the leaf increased in the initial translucent stage of the disease probably as a defense response to fungal attack epicatechin and epigallocatechin levels were less than in healthy tissues at this stage but increases in the corresponding gallate esters suggested that they were being converted into esters although epicatechin and epigallocatechin levels decreased from translucent to mature blister stages the decrease was not significant the decrease in levels of epicatechin epigallocatechin and their esters on infection and the formation of cyanidin and delphinidin on oxidative depolymerization of the blisters suggests that proanthocyanidins may play a role in the defense mechanism the high resistance of a purple green leafed cultivar is attributed to the additional catechin source provided by the high levels of anthocyanins present
are chickadees good listeners antipredator responses to raptor vocalizations ||||| many animals gather information about predators with a variety of cues such as visual acoustic and olfactory several species of birds including chickadees are good at discriminating between species of raptors using visual cues and they can encode information about the threat level in their alarm calls much less is known about how birds discriminate between the calls of different species of predators we played back the calls of three species of raptors to black capped chickadees poecile atricapillus mountain chickadees poecile gambeli and chestnut backed chickadees poecile rufescens to determine whether they can discriminate between them using acoustic cues we played the calls of two species of small high threat raptors northern pygmy owl glaucidium gnoma and sharp shinned hawk accipiter striatus which have very different hunting strategies mainly sit and wait ambush predator versus very fast surprise attack flights we also played a larger lower threat northern goshawk accipiter gentilis black capped and mountain chickadees responded much more to the calls of the two small more dangerous raptors than to the northern goshawk they also responded very differently to the calls of the two small raptors chestnut backed chickadees did not respond differently to the calls of the three raptors these results indicate that black capped and mountain chickadees can make specific discriminations between the calls of these three raptors and that they encode information in their alarm calls in sophisticated ways
abscission and dehiscence in the squirting cucumber ecballium elaterium regulation by ethylene ||||| when treated with ethylene mature fruits of the squirting cucumber ecballium elaterium l a rich abscind and dehisce prematurely abscission of male flowers is also accelerated by ethylene visible signs of senescence a rise in ethylene production and reduced carbon dioxide production always precede abscission or dehiscence in untreated fruits and flowers the amounts of diffusible cellulase increase in tissues on both sides of the fruit abscission zone after exposure to ethylene anatomical features of this abscission zone are described the leaves of ecballium do not abscind although the blade and petiole produce large amounts of ethylene at senescence nor do they separate when ethylene is supplied ethylene treatment of attached fruit peduncles accelerates their rate of elongation in the growing zone below the apical hook the regulation of growth and abscission in these organs is discussed
immunochemical and electrophysiological analyses of magnetically responsive neurons in the mollusc tritonia diomedea ||||| tritonia diomedea uses the earth s magnetic field as an orientation cue but little is known about the neural mechanisms that underlie magnetic orientation behavior in this or other animals six large individually identifiable neurons in the brain of tritonia left and right pd pd pd are known to respond with altered electrical activity to changes in earth strength magnetic fields in this study we used immunochemical electrophysiological and neuroanatomical techniques to investigate the function of the pd neurons the largest magnetically responsive cells immunocytochemical studies localized tpeps neuropeptides isolated from pd to dense cored vesicles within the pd somata and within neurites adjacent to ciliated foot epithelial cells anatomical analyses revealed that neurites from pd are located within nerves innervating the ipsilateral foot and body wall these results imply that pd project to the foot and regulate ciliary beating through paracrine release electrophysiological recordings indicated that although both lpd and rpd responded to the same magnetic stimuli the pattern of spiking in the two cells differed given that tpeps increase ciliary beating and tritonia locomotes using pedal cilia our results are consistent with the hypothesis that pd neurons control or modulate the ciliary activity involved in crawling during orientation behavior

functional morphology and movements of the proboscis of lepidoptera insecta ||||| summarythe mouthparts of lepidoptera were investigated in a number of species by morphological and cinematographical methods both the galeae which compose the proboscis and the basal maxillary components stipites were studied in the resting position in motion and during feeding in the resting position the proboscis is coiled so tightly that the surfaces of the consecutive coils are in close contact and the outermost coil touches the ventral side of the head cuticular processes of the galeal wall interlock between the coils in this position in the investigated species they occur on the galeal wall and on the ventral side of the head in varying number and distribution by the extension of the basal galeal joint the coiled proboscis is released from its resting position and is elevated continuously it uncoils in steps which effect the entire length simultaneously each uncoiling step occurs synchronously with a compression of the stipital tubes on either side of the body these compression movements pump hemolymph into the galeae in all investigated lepidoptera the uncoiled proboscis shows a distinct downward bend at a certain point which is also detectable in anaesthetized or freshly killed animals in some species this feeding position and the movements of the uncoiled proboscis are similar in all species despite the intrinsic galeal muscles being variously arranged in the galeal lumen in different lepidoptera when comparing cross sections through corresponding regions of coiled and uncoiled proboscises the curvatures of the dorsal galeal walls remain unchanged coiling of the proboscis starts at the tip and progresses to the base after coiling the proboscis tightly beneath the head the diameter of the spiral widens due to its elastic properties until the proboscis props itself against the ventral side of the head this elastic effect combined with the interlocking cuticular processes seems to be responsible for the resting position of the proboscis

jackrabbit ears surface temperatures and vascular responses ||||| blood flow to the ear pinnae is curtailed at ambient temperatures of between degrees and degrees c which minimizes heat loss across the pinnae and allows the surfaces of erect pinnae to approach ambient temperature the pinnae are warmed by steady or pulsatile vasodilation in some animals when the ambient temperature is between degree and degrees c below body temperature a response favoring heat loss when ambient temperature exceeds body temperature by degrees to degrees c the pinnae are circulated with blood cooler than ambient temperature this response favors heat influx
bone density and the lightweight skeletons of birds ||||| the skeletons of birds are universally described as lightweight as a result of selection for minimizing the energy required for flight from a functional perspective the weight mass of an animal relative to its lift generating surfaces is a key determinant of the metabolic cost of flight the evolution of birds has been characterized by many weight saving adaptations that are reflected in bone shape many of which strengthen and stiffen the skeleton although largely unstudied in birds the material properties of bone tissue can also contribute to bone strength and stiffness in this study i calculated the density of the cranium humerus and femur in passerine birds rodents and bats by measuring bone mass and volume using helium displacement i found that on average these bones are densest in birds followed closely by bats as bone density increases so do bone stiffness and strength both of these optimization criteria are used in the design of strong and stiff but lightweight manmade airframes by analogy increased bone density in birds and bats may reflect adaptations for maximizing bone strength and stiffness while minimizing bone mass and volume these data suggest that both bone shape and the material properties of bone tissue have played important roles in the evolution of flight they also reconcile the conundrum of how bird skeletons can appear to be thin and delicate yet contribute just as much to total body mass as do the skeletons of terrestrial mammals

xyloglucan endo transglycosylase xet functions in gelatinous layers of tension wood fibers in poplar a glimpse into the mechanism of the balancing act of trees ||||| tension wood is a specialized tissue of deciduous trees that functions in bending woody stems to optimize their position in space tension wood fibers that develop on one side of the stem have an increased potency to shrink compared with fibers on the opposite side thus creating a bending moment it is believed that the gelatinous g cell wall layer containing almost pure cellulose of tension wood fibers is pivotal to their shrinking by analyzing saccharide composition and linkage in isolated g layers of poplar we found that they contain some matrix components in addition to cellulose of which xyloglucan is the most abundant xyloglucan xyloglucan endo transglycosylase xet activity and xyloglucan endo transglycosylase hydrolase xth gene products were detected in developing g layers by labeling using ccrc m monoclonal antibody in situ incorporation of xxxg sr and the polyclonal antibody to poplar pttxet respectively indicating that xyloglucan is incorporated into the g layer during its development moreover several xth transcripts were altered and were generally up regulated in developing tension wood compared with normal wood in mature g fibers xth gene products were detected in the g layers while the xet activity was evident in the adjacent s wall layer we propose that xet activity is essential for g fiber shrinking by repairing xyloglucan cross links between g and s layers and thus maintaining their contact surprisingly xth gene products and xet activity persisted in mature g fibers for several years suggesting that the enzyme functions after cell death repairing the cross links as they are being broken during the shrinking process
naturally occurring nanoparticles from english ivy an alternative to metal based nanoparticles for uv protection ||||| backgroundover the last decade safety concerns have arisen about the use of metal based nanoparticles in the cosmetics field metal based nanoparticles have been linked to both environmental and animal toxicity in a variety of studies perhaps the greatest concern involves the large amounts of tio nanoparticles that are used in commercial sunscreens as an alternative to using these potentially hazardous metal based nanoparticles we have isolated organic nanoparticles from english ivy hedera helix in this study ivy nanoparticles were evaluated for their potential use in sunscreens based on four criteria ability to absorb and scatter ultraviolet light toxicity to mammalian cells biodegradability and potential for diffusion through skin resultspurified ivy nanoparticles were first tested for their uv protective effects using a standard spectrophotometric assay next the cell toxicity of the ivy nanoparticles was compared to tio nanoparticles using hela cells the biodegradability of these nanoparticles was also determined through several digestion techniques finally a mathematical model was developed to determine the potential for ivy nanoparticles to penetrate through human skin the results indicated that the ivy nanoparticles were more efficient in blocking uv light less toxic to mammalian cells easily biodegradable and had a limited potential to penetrate through human skin when compared to tio nanoparticles the ivy nanoparticles showed decreased cell toxicity and were easily degradable indicating that they provided a safer alternative to these nanoparticles conclusionswith the data collected from this study we have demonstrated the great potential of ivy nanoparticles as a sunscreen protective agent and their increased safety over commonly used metal oxide nanoparticles
freeze tolerance and intolerance as strategies of winter survival in terrestrially hibernating amphibians ||||| the ability to tolerate extracellular freezing as an adaptation for winter survival was tested in seven species of terrestrially hibernating amphibians found in eastern canada all species had only moderate supercooling abilities with whole animal supercooling points of to degrees c two salamander species plethodon cinereus and ambystoma laterale and the toad bufo americanus were freezing intolerant and were killed when frozen for hr at temperatures just below their supercooling points the major winter strategy of these animals appears to behavioural avoidance of subzero temperatures four species of frogs rana sylvatica hyla versicolor hyla crucifer and pseudacris triseriata survived extracellular freezing at moderate subzero temperatures to degrees c for periods of time ranging up to weeks all four frog species accumulated low molecular weight carbohydrates as cryoprotectants glycerol being the major cryoprotectant in adult h versicolor while immature adults of this species as well as the other three species all produced high levels of glucose as the cryoprotectant

females floated first in bubble rafting snails ||||| summary ever since mivart asked darwin to explain a bird s use for half a wing biologists have been challenged to explain extraordinary evolutionary change mechanistically here we investigate the enigmatic evolutionary origins of janthinidae a family of marine snails that raft passively in the neuston a vast oceanic surface habitat by constructing floats of mucus bubbles we present the first molecular phylogeny including janthinidae which confirms that janthinids are derived from epitoniidae wentletraps benthic predators and parasites of sea anemones and corals our data support the hypothesis that floats and rafting evolved via modified epitoniid egg masses rather than by juvenile droguing our phylogeny also reveals sequential modifications of float formation and function among janthinid lineages we interpret these changes as sequential adaptations to a neustonic existence a conclusion supported by the positive association of derived janthinid traits with ecological prevalence
a conserved spider silk domain acts as a molecular switch that controls fibre assembly ||||| a huge variety of proteins are able to form fibrillar structures especially at high protein concentrations hence it is surprising that spider silk proteins can be stored in a soluble form at high concentrations and transformed into extremely stable fibres on demand silk proteins are reminiscent of amphiphilic block copolymers containing stretches of polyalanine and glycine rich polar elements forming a repetitive core flanked by highly conserved non repetitive amino terminal and carboxy terminal domains the n terminal domain comprises a secretion signal but further functions remain unassigned the c terminal domain was implicated in the control of solubility and fibre formation initiated by changes in ionic composition and mechanical stimuli known to align the repetitive sequence elements and promote b sheet formation however despite recent structural data little is known about this remarkable behaviour in molecular detail here we present the solution structure of the c terminal domain of a spider dragline silk protein and provide evidence that the structural state of this domain is essential for controlled switching between the storage and assembly forms of silk proteins in addition the c terminal domain also has a role in the alignment of secondary structural features formed by the repetitive elements in the backbone of spider silk proteins which is known to be important for the mechanical properties of the fibre
characterization of a protein based adhesive elastomer secreted by the australian frog notaden bennetti ||||| when provoked notaden bennetti frogs secrete an exudate which rapidly forms a tacky elastic solid frog glue this protein based material acts as a promiscuous pressure sensitive adhesive that functions even in wet conditions we conducted macroscopic tests in air to assess the tensile strength of moist glue up to kpa and the shear strength of dry glue mpa we also performed nanomechanical measurements in water to determine the adhesion nn or greater resilience and elastic modulus kpa of solid glue collected in different ways dry glue contains little carbohydrate and consists mainly of protein the protein complement is rich in gly mol pro mol and glu gln mol it also contains some hydroxyproline mol but no hydroxylysine or dihydroxyphenylalanine l dopa denaturing gel electrophoresis of the glue reveals a characteristic pattern of proteins spanning kda the largest protein nb r apparent molecular mass kda is also the most abundant and this protein appears to be the key structural component the solid glue can be dissolved in dilute acids raising the ionic strength causes the glue components to self assemble spontaneously into a solid which resembles the starting material we describe scattering studies on dissolved and solid glue and provide microscopy images of glue surfaces and sections revealing a porous interior that is consistent with the high water content wt of moist glue in addition to compositional similarities with other biological adhesives and well known elastomeric proteins the circular dichroism spectrum of dissolved glue is almost identical to that for soluble elastin and electron and scanning probe microscopy images invite comparison with silk fibroins covalent cross linking does not seem to be necessary for the glue to set
ultra fast underwater suction traps ||||| carnivorous aquatic utricularia species catch small prey animals using millimetre sized underwater suction traps which have fascinated scientists since darwin s early work on carnivorous plants suction takes place after mechanical triggering and is owing to a release of stored elastic energy in the trap body accompanied by a very fast opening and closing of a trapdoor which otherwise closes the trap entrance watertight the exceptional trapping speed far above human visual perception impeded profound investigations until now using high speed video imaging and special microscopy techniques we obtained fully time resolved recordings of the door movement we found that this unique trapping mechanism conducts suction in less than a millisecond and therefore ranks among the fastest plant movements known fluid acceleration reaches very high values leaving little chance for prey animals to escape we discovered that the door deformation is morphologically predetermined and actually performs a buckling unbuckling process including a complete trapdoor curvature inversion this process which we predict using dynamical simulations and simple theoretical models is highly reproducible the traps are autonomously repetitive as they fire spontaneously after h and reset actively to their ready to catch condition
how the cucumber tendril coils and overwinds ||||| curls beget more curls cucumber tendrils reach up to find an attachment and then coil to shorten and drag the plant up toward the sunlight gerbode et al p analyzed the biomechanics of cucumber tendril coiling the process depends on a thin layer of cells within the tendril that becomes lignified during the coiling process a construct of pre strained silicon sheets fabric ribbon and copper wire reproduced the coiling functions in abiotic materials physical and mathematical models explained the peculiar response by which the cucumber tendril initially overwinds when pulled further plants climb via lifelines that are a mix of strength and flexibility the helical coiling of plant tendrils has fascinated scientists for centuries yet the underlying mechanism remains elusive moreover despite darwin s widely accepted interpretation of coiled tendrils as soft springs their mechanical behavior remains unknown our experiments on cucumber tendrils demonstrate that tendril coiling occurs via asymmetric contraction of an internal fiber ribbon of specialized cells under tension both extracted fiber ribbons and old tendrils exhibit twistless overwinding rather than unwinding with an initially soft response followed by strong strain stiffening at large extensions we explain this behavior using physical models of prestrained rubber strips geometric arguments and mathematical models of elastic filaments collectively our study illuminates the origin of tendril coiling quantifies darwin s original proposal and suggests designs for biomimetic twistless springs with tunable mechanical responses
simple and diversified crop rotations approach and insight into agroecosystems ||||| farm management and the cultivation of soils for production of fiber and food for men and animais has always raised the question of how far man can interfere with the household of nature without disturbing the basis of vital processes as hunter and gatherer man s influence on nature or natural ecosystems was of little importance as soon as the world population increased other methods and forms of producing food developed namely those of modern agriculture
a comparative study of piscine defense the scales of arapaima gigas latimeria chalumnae and atractosteus spatula ||||| we compare the characteristics of the armored scales of three large fish namely the arapaima gigas arapaima latimeria chalumnae coelacanth and atractosteus spatula alligator gar with specific focus on their unique structure mechanical property relationships and their specialized ability to provide protection from predatory pressures with the ultimate goal of providing bio inspiration for manmade materials the arapaima has flexible and overlapping cycloid scales which consist of a tough bouligand type arrangement of collagen layers in the base and a hard external mineralized surface protecting it from piranha a predator with extremely sharp teeth the coelacanth has overlapping elasmoid scales that consist of adjacent bouligand type pairs forming a double twisted bouligand type structure the collagenous layers are connected by collagen fibril struts which significantly contribute to the energy dissipation so that the scales have the capability to defend from predators such as sharks the alligator gar has inflexible articulating ganoid scales made of a hard and highly mineralized enamel like outer surface and a tough dentine like bony base which resist powerful bite forces of self predation and attack by alligators the structural differences between the three scales correspond with the attack of their predators and show refined mechanisms which may be imitated and incorporated into superior bioinspired and biomimetic designs that are specialized to resist specific modes of predation
surface properties of the skin of the pilot whale globicephala melas ||||| on the skin surface of delphinids small biofoulers are challenged to high shear water flow and liquid vapor interfaces of air bubbles during jumping this state of self cleaning is supported by the even nano rough gel coated epidermal surface of the skin the present study focussed on the intercellular evolution of gel formation and the chemical composition of the gel smoothing the skin surface of the pilot whale globicephala melas using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps in combination with cryo scanning electron microscopy csm and transmission electron microscopy tem in the superficial layer of the epidermis the stratum corneum intercellular material was shown by electron optical methods to assemble from smaller into larger covalently cross linked aggregates during the transit of the corneocytes towards the skin surface xps measurements showed that the surface of the skin and the intercellular gel included approximately the same amounts of polar groups especially free amines and amides and non polar groups corresponding to the presence of lipid droplets dispersed within the jelly material it was concluded from the results that the gel coat of the skin surface is a chemically heterogeneous skin product the advantages of chemically heterogeneous patches contributing to the ablation of traces of the biofouling process are discussed
hot bees in empty broodnest cells heating from within ||||| summary honeybee colonies maintain brood nest temperatures of degc we investigated brood nest thermoregulation at the level of individual worker behaviour and the transfer of heat from workers to the brood worker bees contribute to the regulation of brood nest temperature by producing heat while sitting motionless on the caps of brood cells we report here an additional newly observed heating strategy where heating bees enter empty cells between sealed brood cells and remain there motionless for periods of up to min individually marked worker bees on the surface of sealed brood cells maintained thorax temperatures tth between degc and degc mean s d n bees with alternating warming and cooling periods most of the observed bees made one or several long duration visits min to empty cells within the sealed brood area tth at the time bees entered a cell tth entry was degc n in of these cell visits tth entry was higher up to degc mean degc n than the mean tth of the same bee high values of tth entry resulted from preceding heating activity on the comb surface and from warm ups just prior to cell visits during which tth increased by up to degc bees inside empty cells had mean tth values of degc resting bees to degc heat producing bees during long duration cell visits without performing any visible work heating behaviour inside cells resembles heating behaviour on the brood cap surface in that the bees appear to be inactive but repeated warmings and coolings occur and tth does not fall below the optimum brood temperature bees staying still inside empty cells for several minutes have previously been considered to be resting bees we find however that the heating bees can be distinguished from the resting bees not only by their higher body temperatures but also by the continuous rapid respiratory movements of their abdomens by contrast abdominal pumping movements in resting bees are discontinuous and interrupted by long pauses heat transfer to the brood from individual bees on the comb surface and from bees inside empty cells was simulated under controlled conditions heating on the comb surface causes a strong superficial warming of the brood cap by up to degc within min heat transfer is times more efficient when the thorax is in touch with the brood cap than when it is not heating inside empty cells raises the brood temperature of adjacent cells by up to degc within min heat flow through the comb was detectable up to three brood cells away from the heated thorax
design of superior spider silk from nanostructure to mechanical properties ||||| spider dragline silk is of practical interest because of its excellent mechanical properties however the structure of this material is still largely unknown in this article we report what we believe is a new model of the hierarchical structure of silk based on scanning electron microscope and atomic force microscope images this hierarchical structure includes beta sheet polypeptide chain network and silk fibril it turns out that an exceptionally high strength of the spider dragline silk can be obtained by decreasing the size of the crystalline nodes in the polypeptide chain network while increasing the degree of orientation of the crystalline nodes based on this understanding how the reeling speed affects mechanical properties of spider dragline silk can be understood properly hopefully the understanding obtained in this study will shed light on the formation of spider silk and consequently on the principles for the design of ultrastrong silk
the karman gait novel body kinematics of rainbow trout swimming in a vortex street ||||| summary most fishes commonly experience unsteady flows and hydrodynamic perturbations during their lifetime in this study we provide evidence that rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss voluntarily alter their body kinematics when interacting with vortices present in the environment that are not self generated to demonstrate this we measured axial swimming kinematics in response to changes in known hydrodynamic wake characteristics we compared trout swimming in the karman street behind different diameter cylinders and cm at two flow speeds and l s where l is total body length to trout swimming in the free stream and in the cylinder bow wake trout swimming behind cylinders adopt a distinctive previously undescribed pattern of movement in order to hold station which we term the karman gait during this gait body amplitudes and curvatures are much larger than those of trout swimming at an equivalent flow velocity in the absence of a cylinder tail beat frequency is not only lower than might be expected for a trout swimming in the reduced flow behind a cylinder but also matches the vortex shedding frequency of the cylinder therefore in addition to choosing to be in the slower flow velocity offered behind a cylinder drafting trout are also altering their body kinematics to synchronize with the shed vortices tuning using a mechanism that may not involve propulsive locomotion this behavior is most distinctive when cylinder diameter is large relative to fish length while tuning trout have a longer body wavelength than the prescribed wake wavelength indicating that only certain regions of the body may need to be oriented in a consistent manner to the oncoming vortices our results suggest that fish can capture energy from vortices generated by the environment to maintain station in downstream flow interestingly trout swimming in front of a cylinder display lower tail beat amplitudes and body wave speeds than trout subjected to any of the other treatments implying that the bow wake may be the most energetically favorable region for a fish to hold station near a cylinder
organisms as ecosystem engineers ||||| interactions between organisms are a major determinant of the distribution and abundance of species ecology textbooks e g ricklefs krebs begon et al summarise these important interactions as intra and interspecific competition for abiotic and biotic resources predation parasitism and mutualism conspicuously lacking from the list of key processes in most text books is the role that many organisms play in the creation modification and maintenance of habitats these activities do not involve direct trophic interactions between species but they are nevertheless important and common the ecological literature is rich in examples of habitat modification by organisms some of which have been extensively studied e g thayer naiman et al
crosslinking lessons from biology enlisting enzymes for macromolecular assembly ||||| biology is well known for its use of linear polymers to perform sophisticated functions nucleic acids store and process genetic information while proteins perform recognition transport and catalytic functions biology also employs polymers especially proteins and polysaccharides to perform mechanical functions and there are several examples in which biology covalently crosslinks polymers to confer elasticity and strength in some cases the crosslinking enzymes have attracted attention as a simple and safe means for macromolecular processing in vitro here we review recent research with two enzymes tyrosinase and microbial transglutaminase that are being examined for a variety of applications
passive radiative cooling below ambient air temperature under direct sunlight ||||| cooling is a significant end use of energy globally and a major driver of peak electricity demand air conditioning for example accounts for nearly fifteen per cent of the primary energy used by buildings in the united states a passive cooling strategy that cools without any electricity input could therefore have a significant impact on global energy consumption to achieve cooling one needs to be able to reach and maintain a temperature below that of the ambient air at night passive cooling below ambient air temperature has been demonstrated using a technique known as radiative cooling in which a device exposed to the sky is used to radiate heat to outer space through a transparency window in the atmosphere between and micrometres peak cooling demand however occurs during the daytime daytime radiative cooling to a temperature below ambient of a surface under direct sunlight has not been achieved because sky access during the day results in heating of the radiative cooler by the sun here we experimentally demonstrate radiative cooling to nearly degrees celsius below the ambient air temperature under direct sunlight using a thermal photonic approach we introduce an integrated photonic solar reflector and thermal emitter consisting of seven layers of hfo and sio that reflects per cent of incident sunlight while emitting strongly and selectively in the atmospheric transparency window when exposed to direct sunlight exceeding watts per square metre on a rooftop the photonic radiative cooler cools to degrees celsius below ambient air temperature and has a cooling power of watts per square metre at ambient air temperature these results demonstrate that a tailored photonic approach can fundamentally enable new technological possibilities for energy efficiency further the cold darkness of the universe can be used as a renewable thermodynamic resource even during the hottest hours of the day
mechanosensory hairs in bumblebees bombus terrestris detect weak electric fields ||||| significance electroreception in terrestrial animals is poorly understood in bumblebees the mechanical response of filiform hairs in the presence of electric fields provides key evidence for electrosensitivity to ecologically relevant electric fields mechanosensory hairs in arthropods have been shown to function as fluid flow or sound particle velocity receivers the present work provides direct evidence for additional nonexclusive functionality involving electrical coulomb force coupling between distant charged objects and mechanosensory hairs thus the sensory mechanism is proposed to rely on electromechanical coupling whereby many light thin hairs serve the detection of the electrical field surrounding a bumblebee approaching a flower this finding prompts the possibility that other terrestrial animals use such sensory hairs to detect and respond to electric fields bumblebees bombus terrestris use information from surrounding electric fields to make foraging decisions electroreception in air a nonconductive medium is a recently discovered sensory capacity of insects yet the sensory mechanisms remain elusive here we investigate two putative electric field sensors antennae and mechanosensory hairs examining their mechanical and neural response we show that electric fields cause deflections in both antennae and hairs hairs respond with a greater median velocity displacement and angular displacement than antennae extracellular recordings from the antennae do not show any electrophysiological correlates to these mechanical deflections in contrast hair deflections in response to an electric field elicited neural activity mechanical deflections of both hairs and antennae increase with the electric charge carried by the bumblebee from this evidence we conclude that sensory hairs are a site of electroreception in the bumblebee
comparison of surface microfouling and bacterial attachment on the egg capsules of two molluscan species representing cephalopoda and neogastropoda ||||| many organisms naturally defend themselves against microbial attachment and biofoul ing in the marine environment in this study we investigated microbial fouling on molluscan egg capsules using scanning electron microscopy sem two photon laser scanning microscopy tplsm with bacterial viability staining and bacterial attachment experiments with the biofilm forming pseudoalteromonas sp s in flow chambers results indicated that early stage egg capsules of dicathais orbita neogastropoda are relatively free of surface microorganisms egg capsules during the trocophore stage had a regularly ridged microtexture but as capsules matured shedding of the outer wall was observed followed by the extrusion of unidentified droplets which then accumulated on the capsule surface in association with bacteria by comparison the egg capsules of sepioteuthis australis cephalopoda were found to have an irregular surface with many hills and valleys that accommodate colonization by a variety of microorganisms at the later stages of development these squid egg capsules become heavily colonized by algal spores cross sections of egg capsules revealed that s australis capsule walls were about times thicker than d orbita egg capsules staining the egg capsules with baclighttm also revealed a significantly thicker biofilm with more live and dead bacteria on s australis capsules than on those of d orbita p flow chamber exper iments indicated that the surface of s australis capsules provided a suitable substrate for colonization by pseudoalteromonas sp s whereas colonization was significantly less on d orbita egg capsules after and h p these experiments indicated that d orbita egg capsules are better defended against fouling microbes than are the eggs of s australis d orbita appears to use a combi nation of physical mechanical and possibly chemical defense mechanisms to reduce fouling on their egg capsules

tropic failure of phyllactinia corylea contributes to the mildew resistance of mulberry genotypes ||||| different mulberry genotypes show great variation in their resistance to the powdery mildew phyllactinia corylea conidial germination and hyphal growth of p corylea on the leaf surface of two susceptible mulberry genotypes viz kanva k and victory v varieties of morus indica and on two resistant species viz m laevigata and m serrata were studied by scanning electron microscopy conidial germination and growth of germ tubes were normal on all the leaves the hyphae of p coryleaidentify stomata on host leaves by their topographical features to produce the stomatopodia precisely over them the holes and or the grooves of stomata appear to provide the signals for the initiation of stomatopodia and similar structures are erratically developed over many local depressions or grooves on leaf surface the abaxial surface of k leaf is smooth without prominent undulations of epidermal cell surface and the stomata are flush with the leaf surface although successful penetration is also achieved on v leaf its slightly undulated surface occasionally provides inaccurate tropic signals to the hyphae inducing the development of stomatopodia away from the stomata the leaf surfaces of m laevigata and m serrata are very rough with highly sculptured cuticle and abundant epidermal outgrowths stomata mostly remain sunken or hidden amidst the cuticular ornamentations and the hyphae fail to recognise the precise signals from them as the surface architecture of the leaves provides many immense sources of tropic signals stomatopodia are often produced over local depressions or grooves in these cases the fungus fails to penetrate the leaf does not develop beyond h and penetration is rarely achieved on the leaves of the resistant plants the study indicates that the stimulatory effect of the leaf surface topography of resistant varieties misleads the pathogen from successful penetration thus contributing to the plant s resistance
nest moulting in the ant temnothorax albipennis ||||| we showed how super organisms here ant colonies modify their home according to their increasing or decreasing space requirements the ontogeny of wall building by colonies of the ant temnothorax albipennis involves discontinuous rebuilding events that are reminiscent of moulting in insects here for the first time we manipulated worker density by changing nest cavity size instead of worker number thus avoiding accidentally shifting the balance of workers with different propensities for building tasks our results suggest for the first time that history influences wall building in ants when worker density decreases e g with colony diminution as well as when it increases e g with colony growth as shown by earlier work furthermore we found that ants used a greater number of the larger building blocks big sand grains both after cavity expansion and more surprisingly also after cavity contraction the pattern of nest moulting we experimentally manipulated and analysed should provide insights into possible trade offs between the various functions and structural properties of the nest that these animals may have to optimize
study of the geometry and folding pattern of leaves of mimosa pudica ||||| many structural and functional properties possessed by plants have great potentials to stimulate new concepts and innovative ideas in the field of biomimetic engineering the key inputs from biology can be used for creation of efficient and optimized structures the study of the geometry and folding pattern of leaves of mimosa pudica referred as sensitive plant reveals some of the peculiar characteristics during folding and unfolding when the leaf is touched it quickly folds its leaflets and pinnae and droops downward at the petiole attachment with the help of experiments on simulation model the variations in angle of leaflets and degree of compaction after folding are investigated
wood frog adaptations to overwintering in alaska new limits to freezing tolerance ||||| we investigated the ecological physiology and behavior of free living wood frogs lithobates rana sylvaticus overwintering in interior alaska by tracking animals into natural hibernacula recording microclimate and determining frog survival in spring we measured cryoprotectant glucose concentrations and identified the presence of antifreeze glycolipids in tissues from subsamples of naturally freezing frogs we also recorded the behavior of wood frogs preparing to freeze in artificial hibernacula and tissue glucose concentrations in captive wood frogs frozen in the laboratory to degc wood frogs in natural hibernacula remained frozen for consecutive days and experienced average october may temperatures of degc and average minimum temperatures of degc range to degc with survival n mean glucose concentrations were fold higher in muscle fold higher in heart and fold higher in liver in naturally freezing compared with laboratory frozen frogs antifreeze glycolipid was present in extracts from muscle and internal organs but not skin of frozen frogs wood frogs in interior alaska survive freezing to extreme limits and durations compared with those described in animals collected in southern canada or the midwestern united states we hypothesize that this enhancement of freeze tolerance in alaskan wood frogs is due to higher cryoprotectant levels that are produced by repeated freezing and thawing cycles experienced under natural conditions during early autumn
solutes determine the temperature windows for microbial survival and growth ||||| microbial cells and ultimately the earth s biosphere function within a narrow range of physicochemical conditions for the majority of ecosystems productivity is cold limited and it is microbes that represent the failure point this study was carried out to determine if naturally occurring solutes can extend the temperature windows for activity of microorganisms we found that substances known to disorder cellular macromolecules chaotropes did expand microbial growth windows fungi preferentially accumulated chaotropic metabolites at low temperature and chemical activities of solutes determined microbial survival at extremes of temperature as well as pressure this information can enhance the precision of models used to predict if extraterrestrial and other hostile environments are able to support life furthermore chaotropes may be used to extend the growth windows for key microbes such as saprotrophs in cold ecosystems and manmade biomes
artificial muscle begins to breathe ||||| in robots the power source is usually distant from the actual moving parts which can be inefficient one solution is to provide power locally as in real muscles by incorporating fuel cell technology directly into artificial muscles
draculin the anticoagulant factor in vampire bat saliva is a tight binding noncompetitive inhibitor of activated factor x ||||| the kinetic mechanism of action of draculin on activated factor x fxa is established draculin inhibits activated factor x within seconds of incubation at near equimolar concentration times on molar basis fitting the data to the equation for a tight binding inhibitor gives a value for k i k d nm the formation of the draculin fxa complex can be explained by a two step mechanism where for the first reversible step k on s e m x m s and k off x s while for the second irreversible step which is concentration independent k s k d obtained from k off k on nm lineweaver burk plot shows a noncompetitive behavior this noncompetitive mode of inhibition of draculin is supported by the observation that draculin at concentrations giving complete inhibition does not impair binding of p aminobenzamidine to fxa moreover under the same conditions draculin induces decrease of the fluorescence intensity of the p aminobenzamidine fxa complex we conclude that draculin is a noncompetitive tight binding inhibitor of fxa a characteristic so far unique amongst natural fxa inhibitors
a new pollination system dung beetle pollination discovered in orchidantha inouei lowiaceae zingiberales in sarawak malaysia ||||| lowiaceae a family of the zingiberales comprise species in the single genus orchidantha here we present the first report on the pollination of lowiaceae and describe a new system of dung beetle pollination from sarawak borneo orchidantha inouei has a zygomorphic flower located just above the ground observations revealed that the plant is visited frequently and is pollinated by scarabaeid dung beetles mainly members of the genus onthophagus all four species of onthophagus collected on o inouei have also been caught using traps baited with dung or carrion in borneo onthophagus was presumably attracted to the dung like odor of the flower pollination of o inouei is different from other examples of beetle pollination in that its flower provides neither reward nor protected space dung beetles are excellent at following a particular dung scent orchidantha is the only genus that includes species lacking floral nectar it is interesting that this deception pollination using dung beetles was found in zingiberales in which all known species have mutual and specialized relationships with their long distance but costly pollinators bees birds and bats
the structural basis of water permeation and proton exclusion in aquaporins review ||||| aquaporins aqps represent a ubiquitous class of integral membrane proteins that play critical roles in cellular osmoregulations in microbes plants and mammals aqps primarily function as water conducting channels whereas members of a sub class of aqps termed aquaglyceroporins are permeable to small neutral solutes such as glycerol while aqps facilitate transmembrane permeation of water and or small neutral solutes they preclude the conduction of protons consequently openings of aqp channels allow rapid water diffusion down an osmotic gradient without dissipating electrochemical potentials molecular structures of aqps portray unique features that define the two central functions of aqp channels effective water permeation and strict proton exclusion this review describes aqp structures known to date and discusses the mechanisms underlying water permeation proton exclusion and water permeability regulation
directional hearing in a silicon cricket ||||| phonotaxis is the ability to orient towards or away from sound sources crickets can locate conspecifics by phonotaxis to the calling mating song they produce and can evade bats by negative phonotaxis from echolocation calls the behaviour and underlying physiology have been studied in some depth and the auditory system solves this complex problem in a unique manner experiments conducted on a simulation model of the system indicated that the mechanism output a directional signal to sounds ahead at calling song frequency and to sounds behind at echolocation frequencies we suggest that this combination of responses helps simplify later processing in the cricket to further explore this result an analogue very large scale integrated avlsi circuit model of the mechanism was designed and built results from testing this agreed with the simulation the avlsi circuit was used to test a further hypothesis about the potential advantages of the positioning of the acoustic inputs for sound localisation during walking there was no clear advantage to the directionality of the system in their location the avlsi circuitry is now being extended to use on a robot along with previously modelled neural circuitry to better understand the complete sensorimotor pathway
optimal predator risk assessment by the sonar jamming arctiine moth bertholdia trigona ||||| nearly all animals face a tradeoff between seeking food and mates and avoiding predation optimal escape theory holds that an animal confronted with a predator should only flee when benefits of flight increased survival outweigh the costs energetic costs lost foraging time etc we propose a model for prey risk assessment based on the predator s stage of attack risk level should increase rapidly from when the predator detects the prey to when it commits to the attack we tested this hypothesis using a predator the echolocating bat whose active biosonar reveals its stage of attack we used a prey defense clicking used for sonar jamming by the tiger moth bertholdia trigona that can be readily studied in the field and laboratory and is enacted simultaneously with evasive flight we predicted that prey employ defenses soon after being detected and targeted and that prey defensive thresholds discriminate between legitimate predatory threats and false threats where a nearby prey is attacked laboratory and field experiments using playbacks of ultrasound signals and naturally behaving bats respectively confirmed our predictions moths clicked soon after bats detected and targeted them also b trigona clicking thresholds closely matched predicted optimal thresholds for discriminating legitimate and false predator threats for bats using search and approach phase echolocation the period when bats are searching for and assessing prey to our knowledge this is the first quantitative study to correlate the sensory stimuli that trigger defensive behaviors with measurements of signals provided by predators during natural attacks in the field we propose theoretical models for explaining prey risk assessment depending on the availability of cues that reveal a predator s stage of attack
insect communication no entry signal in ant foraging ||||| forager ants lay attractive trail pheromones to guide nestmates to food but the effectiveness of foraging networks might be improved if pheromones could also be used to repel foragers from unrewarding routes here we present empirical evidence for such a negative trail pheromone deployed by pharaoh s ants monomorium pharaonis as a no entry signal to mark an unrewarding foraging path this finding constitutes another example of the sophisticated control mechanisms used in self organized ant colonies
sodium transporters in plants diverse genes and physiological functions ||||| soil salinity represents an increasing threat to agricultural production high sodium na concentrations in soils are toxic to most higher plants more than of irrigated lands worldwide show increased salt levels several studies have shown that under saline conditions na influx into root

self organized lane formation and optimized traffic flow in army ants ||||| we show how the movement rules of individual ants on trails can lead to a collective choice of direction and the formation of distinct traffic lanes that minimize congestion we develop and evaluate the results of a new model with a quantitative study of the behaviour of the army ant eciton burchelli colonies of this species have up to foragers and transport more than prey items per hour over raiding columns that exceed m it is an ideal species in which to test the predictions of our model because it forms pheromone trails that are densely populated with very swift ants the model explores the influences of turning rates and local perception on traffic flow the behaviour of real army ants is such that they occupy the specific region of parameter space in which lanes form and traffic flow is maximized
cloning characterization and expression of escapin a broadly antimicrobial fad containing l amino acid oxidase from ink of the sea hare aplysia californica ||||| summary a kda monomeric protein isolated from the defensive purple ink secretion of the sea hare aplysia californica was cloned and sequenced and is the first sea hare antimicrobial protein to be functionally expressed in e coli sequence analysis suggested that this protein is a flavin containing l amino acid oxidase laao with one predicted potential glycosylation site although the glycosylation could not be experimentally confirmed this protein which we call escapin has high sequence similarity to several other gastropod proteins escapin was verified by nmr mass spectroscopy and hplc to have fad as its flavin cofactor escapin s antimicrobial effects bacteriostasis and bactericidal were determined using a combination of two assays incubation of bacteria on solid media followed by assessment of inhibition by direct observation of zones of inhibition or by turbidity measurements and incubation of bacteria in liquid media followed by counting viable colonies after growing on agar plates native escapin inhibited the growth of gram positive and gram negative bacteria including marine bacteria vibrio harveyii and staphylococcus aureus and pathogenic bacteria staphylococcus aureus streptococcus pyogenes and pseudomonas aeruginosa escapin also inhibited the growth of yeast and fungi with different efficacies escapin s antimicrobial activity was concentration dependent and did not decrease when stored for more than months at room temperature escapin was bacteriostatic and not bactericidal in minimal media e g salt media with glucose yeast extract and a mixture of amino acids each at mmol l but was bactericidal in media enriched with tryptone peptone escapin was also strongly bactericidal in media with l lysine at concentrations as low as mmol l and slightly bactericidal in mmol l l arginine but not in most other amino acids even at mmol l escapin had high oxidase activity producing hydrogen peroxide with either l arginine or l lysine as a substrate and little to no oxidase activity with other l amino acids hydrogen peroxide alone without escapin or amino acids was strongly bacteriostatic but poorly bactericidal similar in this respect to l arginine but different from l lysine in the presence of escapin together these results suggest that there are multiple mechanisms to escapin s antimicrobial effects with bacteriostasis resulting largely or entirely from the effects of hydrogen peroxide produced by escapin s laao activity but bactericidal effects resulting from lysine dependent mechanisms not directly involving hydrogen peroxide recombinant escapin expressed in bacteria was also active against gram positive and gram negative bacteria suggesting that glycosylation is not essential for antimicrobial activity
remora fish suction pad attachment is enhanced by spinule friction ||||| abstract the remora fishes are capable of adhering to a wide variety of natural and artificial marine substrates using a dorsal suction pad the pad is made of serial parallel pectinated lamellae which are homologous to the dorsal fin elements of other fishes small tooth like projections of mineralized tissue from the dorsal pad lamella known as spinules are thought to increase the remora s resistance to slippage and thereby enhance friction to maintain attachment to a moving host in this work the geometry of the spinules and host topology as determined by micro computed tomography and confocal microscope data respectively are combined in a friction model to estimate the spinule contribution to shear resistance model results are validated with natural and artificially created spinules and compared with previous remora pull off experiments it was found that spinule geometry plays an essential role in friction enhancement especially at short spatial wavelengths in the host surface and that spinule tip geometry is not correlated with lamellar position furthermore comparisons with pull off experiments suggest that spinules are primarily responsible for friction enhancement on rough host topologies such as shark skin summary the geometry of remora fish suction disc spinules increases passive friction on rough host surfaces such as shark skin
ecological impact of beavers castor fiber and castor canadensis and their ability to modify ecosystems ||||| the genus castor comprises two species the eurasian beaver castor fibre and the north american beaver castor canadensis both species suffered from overexploitation but have seen a revival since the s due to increased protection and reintroduction programmes increases in the populations and distributions of species that are able to modify ecosystems have generated much scientific interest here we review the available literature concerning the possible ecological impact of beaver species in the old and new world beavers being ecosystem engineers are among the few species besides humans that can significantly change the geomorphology and consequently the hydrological characteristics and biotic properties of the landscape in so doing beavers increase heterogeneity and habitat and species diversity at the landscape scale beaver foraging also has a considerable impact on the course of ecological succession species composition and structure of plant commu nities making them a good example of ecologically dominant species e g keystone species nevertheless the strength of beavers impact varies from site to site depending on the geographical location relief and the impounded habitat type consequently they may not be significant controlling agents of the ecosystem in all parts of their distribution but have strong interactions only under certain circumstances we suggest that beavers can create important management opportunities in the holarctic and this review will help land man agers determine the likely outcome of beaver activity
intertidal trees consequences of aggregation on the mechanical and photosynthetic properties of sea palms postelsia palmaeformis ruprecht ||||| sea palms postelsia palmaeformis ruprecht are annual brown algae that grow on wave swept rocky shores oren forming dense stands unlike most macroalgae postelsia stands upright in air like trees the stipe flexibility that permits postelsia to withstand waves is provided by the low elastic modulus mpa of stipe tissue in spite of the weakness low breaking stress mpa of this tissue a large amount of energy kj m is required to break a stipe because they can be extended by before breaking although made of such easily deformed tissue postelsia can stand upright in air due to the width high second moment of area and resilience of their stipes but the brittleness low work of fracture j m that accompanies this resilience renders them susceptible to bre age if they sustain deep scratches although wave induced stresses experienced by individuals in aggregations are not lower than those experienced by isolated sea palms photon flux densities of photosynthetically active radiation within these dense groves are less than of those above postelsia canopies a number of morphological features differ between canopy understory and isolated individuals canopy plants in dense aggregations are taller than isolated individuals and may exceed limiting proportions for elastic stability postelsia shows photo synthetic characteristics of shade adapted plants understory individuals being especially effective at using low light despite this blade growth rates of understory plants are lower than those of either canopy or isolated individuals
editorial a current perspective on photocatalysis ||||| the efficient conversion of solar photons into solar electricity and solar fuels is one of the most important scientific challenges of this century owing to dwindling fossil fuel reserves and the need for clean energy while research in the direct conversion of solar energy to electricity in the areas of low cost photovoltaic pv systems based on all inorganic semiconductors dye sensitized solar cells organic and molecular pv is more technically advanced than its direct conversion to fuels electricity may not be the ultimate primary solar energy conversion choice owing to the intermittence of solar radiation the considerable energy loss during transmission the availability of cost effective storage media for electricity and the continuing need for liquid transportation fuels on the other hand the direct conversion of solar photons to fuels such as h sub co alcohols and hydrocarbons using h sub o and co sub as feedstocks offers a solution for the storage and distribution of solar energy in the form of stable chemical bonds that can be activated to provide energy at arbitrary times and locations the latter approach to photocatalysis is generally called artificial photosynthesis and has received renewed interest over the past five or so years while photocatalysis has not traditionallymore been restricted to the generation of solar fuels and has included the production of other useful chemicals polymerization and environmental remediation applications the recent upsurge of interest has been driven mostly by renewable energy issues it was the pioneering work on photo electrochemical splitting of water to h sub and o sub by n type tio sub using ultraviolet light by fujishima and honda in that ushered in the area of research that has come to be known as solar fuels and that has led to the terms photocatalysis and solar fuels becoming almost synonymous this special issue of chemsuschem is devoted to providing a current perspective on the field of photocatalysis it contains invited papers from leading researchers in a wide range of important aspects of the field that address materials photophysical photochemical and electrocatalysis issues the area remains primarily the domain of basic research studies because progress toward the promise offered by the early work has at least until recently been slow despite its significance having become increasingly recognized the present collection of papers deals with new semiconductor photocatalysts molecular catalysts for hydrogen production and water oxidation dye sensitized photoelectrochemical cells and electrochemical co sub reduction overall photochemical water splitting without any applied bias potential is achieved in several systems especially under uv irradiation further advances are also achieved in a few semiconductor systems such as gazn oxynitrides or two step so called z scheme systems to produce h sub and o sub without any sacrificial reagent under visible irradiation when band gaps of semiconductors are narrowed to absorb more visible light for greater efficiency or when band positions are not suitable for carrying out one electron redox processes multielectron catalysts are required to promote proton coupled electron transfer reactions in producing solar fuels in homogeneous photocatalysis systems sacrificial reagents are typically used to investigate the catalytic activity detailed kinetics and mechanisms of a half reaction photoelectrolysis systems with immobilized catalysts metals metal oxides or molecular catalysts on electrodes can separate oxidized products such as o sub and reduced products such as h sub co ch sub oh and others by means of proton or hydroxide conducting membranes the following paragraphs briefly summarize these contributions in the area of uv driven water splitting townsend et al prepared pt and or iro sub x coated niobate nb sub o sub sup nanoscrolls and tested photochemical water reduction with methanol as a sacrificial reagent and water oxidation with agno sub as a sacrificial reagent in this work factors for improving the limited photocatalytic activity of the system are explored nishiyama et al investigated factors controlling the photocatalytic water splitting activity such as preparation temperature and crystallinity of the semiconductor materials the amount of co catalyst loading and the degree of dispersion of the co catalyst with ruo sub loaded niobium and tantalum bronzes m sub p sub o sub sup m nb ta their dft calculations demonstrate that severe distortion of nbo sub octahedra plays an important role in photocatalytic water splitting less
coordinated movements prevent jamming in an emperor penguin huddle ||||| for emperor penguins aptenodytes forsteri huddling is the key to survival during the antarctic winter penguins in a huddle are packed so tightly that individual movements become impossible reminiscent of a jamming transition in compacted colloids it is crucial however that the huddle structure is continuously reorganized to give each penguin a chance to spend sufficient time inside the huddle compared with time spent on the periphery here we show that emperor penguins move collectively in a highly coordinated manner to ensure mobility while at the same time keeping the huddle packed every seconds all penguins make small steps that travel as a wave through the entire huddle over time these small movements lead to large scale reorganization of the huddle our data show that the dynamics of penguin huddling is governed by intermittency and approach to kinetic arrest in striking analogy with inert non equilibrium systems including soft glasses and colloids
mechanics of cutting maneuvers by ostriches struthio camelus ||||| summary we studied the strategies used by cursorial bipeds ostriches to maneuver during running eight ostriches were induced to run along a trackway and execute turns ground reaction forces and three dimensional kinematics of the body and leg joints were simultaneously recorded allowing calculation of joint angles and quasi static net joint torques sidesteps where the leg on the outside of the turn changes the movement direction and crossovers using the inside leg occurred with nearly equal frequency ostriches executed maneuvers using a simple control strategy that required minimal changes to leg kinematics or net torque production at individual joints although ostriches did use acceleration or braking forces to control body rotation their morphology allowed for both crossovers and sidesteps to be accomplished with minimal net acceleratory braking force production moreover body roll and ab adduction of the leg shifted the foot position away from the turn direction reducing the acceleratory braking forces required to prevent under or over rotation and aligning the leg with the ground reaction force
energy saving in flight formation ||||| many species of large bird fly together in formation perhaps because flight power demands and energy expenditure can be reduced when the birds fly at an optimal spacing or because orientation is improved by communication within groups we have measured heart rates as an estimate of energy expenditure in imprinted great white pelicans pelecanus onocrotalus trained to fly in v formation and show that these birds save a significant amount of energy by flying in formation this advantage is probably a principal reason for the evolution of flight formation in large birds that migrate in groups
spontaneous unraveling of hagfish slime thread skeins is mediated by a seawater soluble protein adhesive ||||| hagfishes are known for their ability to rapidly produce vast quantities of slime when provoked the slime is formed via the interaction between seawater and two components released by the slime glands mucin vesicles from gland mucous cells which swell and rupture in seawater to form a network of mucus strands and intermediate filament rich threads which are produced within gland thread cells as tightly coiled bundles called skeins a previous study showed that the unraveling of skeins from atlantic hagfish myxine glutinosa requires both the presence of mucins and hydrodynamic mixing in contrast skeins from pacific hagfish eptatretus stoutii unravel in the absence of both mucins and mixing we tested the hypothesis that spontaneous unraveling of e stoutii skeins is triggered by the dissolution of a seawater soluble protein adhesive and the release of stored strain energy within the coiled thread here we show that as predicted by this hypothesis unraveling can be initiated by a protease under conditions in which unraveling does not normally occur we also demonstrate using high resolution scanning electron microscopy that the treatment of skeins with solutions that cause unraveling also leads to the disappearance of surface and inter thread features that remain when skeins are washed with stabilizing solutions our study provides a mechanism for the deployment of thread skeins in pacific hagfish slime and raises the possibility of producing novel biomimetic protein adhesives that are salt temperature and kosmotrope sensitive
inter plant communication through mycorrhizal networks mediates complex adaptive behaviour in plant communities ||||| trees can communicate with each other through networks in soil much like social networks or neural networks the fungal mycelia of mycorrhizas allow signals to be sent between trees in a forest these mycorrhizal networks are effectively an information highway with recent studies demonstrating the exchange of nutritional resources defence signals and allelochemicals sensing and responding to networked signals elicits complex behavioural responses in plants this ability to communicate tree talk is a foundational process in forest ecosystems
how cats lap water uptake by felis catus ||||| lap cats we all know that domestic cats lap milk but perhaps fewer of us have thought about how they do this reis et al p published online november see the cover have discovered that cats curl their tongues so that the top surface touches the water then by lifting their tongues rapidly a column of liquid grows by inertia until gravity induces its breakage and the cats close their jaws to capture the liquid lapping frequency is tuned to maximize the volume ingested depending on the animal s mass a relationship that holds as true for tabby cats as it does for lions cats use fluid inertia to generate a liquid column that they catch in their mouths before gravity destroys it animals have developed a range of drinking strategies depending on physiological and environmental constraints vertebrates with incomplete cheeks use their tongue to drink the most common example is the lapping of cats and dogs we show that the domestic cat felis catus laps by a subtle mechanism based on water adhesion to the dorsal side of the tongue a combined experimental and theoretical analysis reveals that felis catus exploits fluid inertia to defeat gravity and pull liquid into the mouth this competition between inertia and gravity sets the lapping frequency and yields a prediction for the dependence of frequency on animal mass measurements of lapping frequency across the family felidae support this prediction which suggests that the lapping mechanism is conserved among felines
alternation between attachment mechanisms by limpets in the field ||||| the attachment mechanism used by limpets in the rocky wave swept intertidal zone of california was determined during high tide and low tide the two mechanisms that limpets are known to use suction and glue like adhesion were distinguished by measuring the limpets attachment forces in shear and by staining for glue like residues where the limpets had been attached the results show that of limpets at high tide use suction while the rest use glue like adhesion conversely of limpets at low tide use glue like adhesion while the rest use suction the normal tenacity of limpets was also measured at high and low tide the mean tenacity at high tide was significantly less than that at low tide from these data it was estimated that the mean tenacity of glue like adhesion is mn m and the mean tenacity of suction adhesion is mn m it is hypothesized that the cycle of alternating attachment mechanisms is linked to the limpets foraging cycles
honeybee flight a novel streamlining response ||||| summary animals that move rapidly through the air can save considerable energy by reducing the drag that they need to overcome during flight we describe a novel streamlining response in tethered flying honeybees in which the abdomen is held in a raised position when the visual system is exposed to a pattern of image motion that is characteristic of forward flight this visually evoked response which can be elicited without exposing the insect to any airflow presumably serves to reduce the aerodynamic drag that would otherwise be produced by the abdomen during real flight the response is critically dependent on the presence of appropriate image motion everywhere within the large field of view of the insect thus our results also underscore the importance of using panoramic stimulation for the study of visually guided flight in insects and reveal the relative importance of various regions of the visual field in assessing the speed of flight through the environment
distributed graph coloring an approach based on the calling behavior of japanese tree frogs ||||| graph coloring also known as vertex coloring considers the problem of assigning colors to the nodes of a graph such that adjacent nodes do not share the same color the optimization version of the problem concerns the minimization of the number of colors used in this paper we deal with the problem of finding valid graphs colorings in a distributed way that is by means of an algorithm that only uses local information for deciding the color of the nodes the algorithm proposed in this paper is inspired by the calling behavior of japanese tree frogs male frogs use their calls to attract females interestingly groups of males that are located near each other desynchronize their calls this is because female frogs are only able to correctly localize male frogs when their calls are not too close in time the proposed algorithm makes use of this desynchronization behavior for the assignment of different colors to neighboring nodes we experimentally show that our algorithm is very competitive with the current state of the art using different sets of problem instances and comparing to one of the most competitive algorithms from the literature
avoidance and tolerance of freezing in ectothermic vertebrates ||||| summary ectothermic vertebrates have colonized regions that are seasonally or perpetually cold and some species particularly terrestrial hibernators must cope with temperatures that fall substantially below degc survival of such excursions depends on either freeze avoidance through supercooling or freeze tolerance supercooling a metastable state in which body fluids remain liquid below the equilibrium freezing melting point is promoted by physiological responses that protect against chilling injury and by anatomical and behavioral traits that limit risk of inoculative freezing by environmental ice and ice nucleating agents freeze tolerance evolved from responses to fundamental stresses to permit survival of the freezing of a substantial amount of body water under thermal and temporal conditions of ecological relevance survival of freezing is promoted by a complex suite of molecular biochemical and physiological responses that limit cell death from excessive shrinkage damage to macromolecules and membranes metabolic perturbation and oxidative stress although freeze avoidance and freeze tolerance generally are mutually exclusive strategies a few species can switch between them the mode used in a particular instance of chilling depending on prevailing physiological and environmental conditions
bamboo inspired optimal design for functionally graded hollow cylinders ||||| the optimal distribution of the reinforcing fibers for stiffening hollow cylindrical composites is explored using the linear elasticity theory the spatial distribution of the vascular bundles in wild bamboo a nature designed functionally graded material is the basis for the design our results suggest that wild bamboos maximize their flexural rigidity by optimally regulating the radial gradation of their vascular bundle distribution this fact provides us with a plant mimetic design principle that enables the realization of high stiffness and lightweight cylindrical composites
harnessing disorder onychophorans use highly unstructured proteins not silks for prey capture ||||| onychophora are ancient carnivorous soft bodied invertebrates which capture their prey in slime that originates from dedicated glands located on either side of the head while the biochemical composition of the slime is known its unusual nature and the mechanism of ensnaring thread formation have remained elusive we have examined gene expression in the slime gland from an australian onychophoran euperipatoides rowelli and matched expressed sequence tags to separated proteins from the slime the analysis revealed three categories of protein present unique high molecular weight proline rich proteins and smaller concentrations of lectins and small peptides the latter two likely to act as protease inhibitors and antimicrobial agents the predominant proline rich proteins kda are composed of tandem repeated motifs and distinguished by an unusually high proline and charged residue content unlike the highly structured proteins such as silks used for prey capture by spiders and insects these proteins lack ordered secondary structure over their entire length we propose that on expulsion of slime from the gland onto prey evaporative water loss triggers a glass transition change in the protein solution resulting in adhesive and enmeshing thread formation assisted by cross linking of complementary charged and hydrophobic regions of the protein euperipatoides rowelli has developed an entirely new method of capturing prey by harnessing disordered proteins rather than structured silk like proteins
an experimental test of the contributions and condition dependence of microstructure and carotenoids in yellow plumage coloration ||||| a combination of structural and pigmentary components is responsible for many of the colour displays of animals despite the ubiquity of this type of coloration neither the relative contribution of structures and pigments to variation in such colour displays nor the relative effects of extrinsic factors on the structural and pigment based components of such colour has been determined understanding the sources of colour variation is important because structures and pigments may convey different information to conspecifics in an experiment on captive american goldfinches carduelis tristis we manipulated two parameters carotenoid availability and food availability known to affect the expression of carotenoid pigments in a full factorial design yellow feathers from these birds were then analysed in two ways first we used full spectrum spectrometry and high performance liquid chromatography to examine the extent to which variation in white structural colour and total carotenoid content was associated with variation in colour properties of feathers the carotenoid content of yellow feathers predicted two colour parameters principal component representing high values of ultraviolet and yellow chroma and low values of violet blue chroma and hue two different colour parameters violet blue and yellow chroma from white de pigmented feathers as well as carotenoid content predicted reflectance measurements from yellow feathers second we determined the relative effects of our experimental manipulations on white structural colour and yellow colour carotenoid availability directly affected yellow colour while food availability affected it only in combination with carotenoid availability none of our manipulations had significant effects on the expression of white structural colour our results suggest that the contribution of microstructures to variation in the expression of yellow coloration is less than the contribution of carotenoid content and that carotenoid deposition is more dependent on extrinsic variability than is the production of white structural colour
towards ultrahydrophobic surfaces a biomimetic approach ||||| we report on efforts to mimic the wetting behaviour of surfaces or leaves of certain plants which are rendered ultrahydrophobic through a dense layer of hairs grown on top of the leaf we use a simple moulding approach to obtain elastic hydrophilic hydrogel networks with pillar structures that may serve as model systems for such hairy surfaces in order to generate such structures we first generate either a steel master or directly use a lady s mantle leaf second the master is moulded against a silicone to yield an elastomer which is a negative of the hairy surface a subsequent radical polymerization in the negative leads to the formation of an elastic hydrogel even for the very high aspect ratios characteristic of the natural system the results of some preliminary contact angle measurements on the obtained structures are discussed
propulsive force calculations in swimming frogs ii application of a vortex ring model to dpiv data ||||| summary frogs propel themselves by kicking water backwards using a synchronised extension of their hind limbs and webbed feet to understand this propulsion process we quantified the water movements and displacements resulting from swimming in the green frog rana esculenta applying digital particle image velocimetry dpiv to the frog s wake the wake showed two vortex rings left behind by the two feet the rings appeared to be elliptic in planform urging for correction of the observed ring radii the rings long and short axes average ratio were about the same size as the length and width of the propelling frog foot and the ellipsoid mass of water accelerated with it average thrust forces were derived from the vortex rings assuming all propulsive energy to be compiled in the rings the calculated average forces fav n were in close agreement with our parallel study applying a momentum impulse approach to water displacements during the leg extension phase we did not find any support for previously assumed propulsion enhancement mechanisms the feet do not clap together at the end of the power stroke and no wedge action jetting is observed each foot accelerates its own water mantle ending up in a separate vortex ring without interference by the other leg
revisiting a medical case of stinging in the human oral cavity caused by ingestion of raw squid cephalopoda teuthida new data on the functioning of squid s spermatophores ||||| male squid produce intricate spermatophores that when transferred to the female undergo the spermatophoric reaction a complex process of evagination that leads to the attachment of the spermatangium that is the everted spermatophore containing the sperm mass while this process is still not completely understood the medical literature includes several reports of oral stinging i e punctured wounds in the human oral cavity following consumption of raw male squid which contains undischarged spermatophores able to inflict such wounds here we revisit a recent medical report of oral stinging by shiraki et al pathol int providing an in depth reanalysis of their histological biopsies and revealing vital information on the functioning of squid spermatophores the morphology of the spermatangia attached within the oral cavity is similar to the condition found in spermatangia naturally attached to female squids the spermatangia were able to superficially puncture the superficial layers of the oral stratified squamous epithelium and numerous minute stellate particles from the squid spermatophore were found adhered to the oral epithelium these findings corroborate previous hypotheses on the functioning of squid spermatophores namely that spermatophore attachment generally involves tissue scarification and that stellate particles play a vital role in the attachment process moreover spermatophore attachment is confirmed to be autonomous i e performed by the spermatophore itself in another squid species possibly a loliginid and the results strongly indicate that the attachment mechanism is not dependent upon a specialized epithelium nor a mate s specific chemical stimulus from the pathological point of view the best prophylactic measure at present is the removal of the internal organs of the raw squid prior to its consumption
bioluminescence in the benthopelagic holothurian enypniastes eximia ||||| enypniastes eximia echinodermata holothuroidea is a prominent member of the benthic boundary layer community in deep caribbean waters like most holothurians it feeds on benthic sediments feeding is episodic and after collecting food on the bottom it returns to the water column at altitudes within about m of the sea floor direct observations from submersibles and laboratory studies of living specimens have shown how bioluminescence is produced light production in e eximia is triggered mechanically and is produced by hundreds of granular bodies within the gelatinous integument of the animal local stimulation yields a localized response which gradually spreads to the entire surface of the animal broad impact yields a whole body luminescent response the integument of e eximia is quite fragile and strong physical contact readily causes the skin to be sloughed off in a glowing cloud the degree of luminous response is a function of the severity of contact in the laboratory the skin of e eximia along with its luminescent capability regenerated rapidly the anti predatory role of bioluminescence in this species is apparently a burglar alarm strategy in the dark near bottom habitat physical contact by a predator elicits light production which reveals the presence of the attacker to its own visually cued predators
insect tricks two phasic foot pad secretion prevents slipping ||||| many insects cling to vertical and inverted surfaces with pads that adhere by nanometre thin films of liquid secretion this fluid is an emulsion consisting of watery droplets in an oily continuous phase the detailed function of its two phasic nature has remained unclear here we show that the pad emulsion provides a mechanism that prevents insects from slipping on smooth substrates we discovered that it is possible to manipulate the adhesive secretion in vivo using smooth polyimide substrates that selectively absorb its watery component while thick layers of polyimide spin coated onto glass removed all visible hydrophilic droplets thin coatings left the emulsion in its typical form force measurements of stick insect pads sliding on these substrates demonstrated that the reduction of the watery phase resulted in a significant decrease in friction forces artificial control pads made of polydimethylsiloxane showed no difference when tested on the same substrates confirming that the effect is caused by the insects fluid based adhesive system our findings suggest that insect adhesive pads use emulsions with non newtonian properties which may have been optimized by natural selection emulsions as adhesive secretions combine the benefits of wet adhesion and resistance against shear forces
force production and flow structure of the leading edge vortex on flapping wings at high and low reynolds numbers ||||| summary the elevated aerodynamic performance of insects has been attributed in part to the generation and maintenance of a stable region of vorticity known as the leading edge vortex lev one explanation for the stability of the lev is that spiraling axial flow within the vortex core drains energy into the tip vortex forming a leading edge spiral vortex analogous to the flow structure generated by delta wing aircraft however whereas spiral flow is a conspicuous feature of flapping wings at reynolds numbers re of similar experiments at re failed to identify a comparable structure we used a dynamically scaled robot to investigate both the forces and the flows created by a wing undergoing identical motion at re of and in both cases motion at constant angular velocity and fixed angle of attack generated a stable lev with no evidence of shedding at re flow visualization indicated an intense narrow region of spanwise flow within the core of the lev a feature conspicuously absent at re the results suggest that the transport of vorticity from the leading edge to the wake that permits prolonged vortex attachment takes different forms at different re
running in ostriches struthio camelus three dimensional joint axes alignment and joint kinematics ||||| summary although locomotor kinematics in walking and running birds have been examined in studies exploring many biological aspects of bipedalism these studies have been largely limited to two dimensional analyses incorporating a five segment degree of freedom d f kinematic model of the ostrich hind limb developed from anatomical specimens we quantified the three dimensional d joint axis alignment and joint kinematics during running at m s in the largest avian biped the ostrich our analysis revealed that the majority of the segment motion during running in the ostrich occurs in flexion extension importantly however the alignment of the average flexion extension helical axes of the knee and ankle are rotated externally to the direction of travel deg and deg respectively so that pure flexion and extension at the knee will act to adduct and adbuct the tibiotarsus relative to the plane of movement and pure flexion and extension at the ankle will act to abduct and adduct the tarsometatarsus relative to the plane of movement this feature of the limb anatomy appears to provide the major lateral non sagittal displacement of the lower limb necessary for steering the swinging limb clear of the stance limb and replaces what would otherwise require greater adduction abduction and or internal external rotation allowing for less complex joints musculoskeletal geometry and neuromuscular control significant rotation about the joints non flexion extension axes nevertheless occurs over the running stride in particular hip abduction and knee internal external and varus valgus motion may further facilitate limb clearance during the swing phase and substantial non flexion extension movement at the knee is also observed during stance measurement of d segment and joint motion in birds will be aided by the use of functionally determined axes of rotation rather than assumed axes proving important when interpreting the biomechanics and motor control of avian bipedalism
periodical cicadas as resource pulses in north american forests ||||| resource pulses are occasional events of ephemeral resource superabundance that occur in many ecosystems aboveground consumers in diverse communities often respond strongly to resource pulses but few studies have investigated the belowground consequences of resource pulses in natural ecosystems this study shows that resource pulses of year periodical cicadas magicicada spp directly increase microbial biomass and nitrogen availability in forest soils with indirect effects on growth and reproduction in forest plants these findings suggest that pulses of periodical cicadas create bottom up cascades resulting in strong and reciprocal links between the aboveground and belowground components of a north american forest ecosystem

geographic variation in halogenated furanones from the red alga delisea pulchra and associated herbivores and epiphytes ||||| we examine patterns of quantitative variation in halogenated furanones secondary metabolites of delisea pulchra rhodophyta bonnemaisoniales and how this relates to variation in local abundance of herbivores and epiphytes fifteen populations of d pulchra covering a distance of km of temperate southeastern australia were sampled concentrations of the main furanones in d pulchra compounds to showed large variability but there was no latitudinal trend to this variation we found significant variation in the concentrations of both total and individual furanones among locations between summer and winter and between different life history stages importantly the range of total furanone concentration among plants within locations was large often varying by an order of magnitude or more a total of species of herbivorous fish species of macroinvertebrate grazer and groups of mesograzer of varying taxonomic level were found at the locations the abundance of both total macroinvertebrate grazers and total mesograzers known to consume d pul chra varied significantly among locations however correlations between furanones and the abun dance of macroinvertebrate grazers and mesograzers at the scale of location were all weak and non significant as was the correlation between furanones and the abundance of epiphytes on d pulchra the large variability in concentrations of furanones and the absence of any positive relationships between furanones herbivores and epiphytes suggest that quantitative variation in furanones in d pulchra is not driven by population level selection or induction but is more likely to be a result of small scale variation in environmental factors such as nutrients and light and genetic differences among individual plants
remarkable resilience of teeth ||||| tooth enamel is inherently weak with fracture toughness comparable with glass yet it is remarkably resilient surviving millions of functional contacts over a lifetime we propose a microstructural mechanism of damage resistance based on observations from ex situ loading of human and sea otter molars teeth with strikingly similar structural features section views of the enamel implicate tufts hypomineralized crack like defects at the enamel dentin junction as primary fracture sources we report a stabilization in the evolution of these defects by stress shielding from neighbors by inhibition of ensuing crack extension from prism interweaving decussation and by self healing these factors coupled with the capacity of the tooth configuration to limit the generation of tensile stresses in largely compressive biting explain how teeth may absorb considerable damage over time without catastrophic failure an outcome with strong implications concerning the adaptation of animal species to diet
decay of cacti and carbon cycling ||||| cacti contain large quantities of ca oxalate biominerals with c derived from atmospheric co their death releases these biominerals into the environment which subsequently transform to calcite via a monohydrocalcite intermediate here the fate of ca oxalates released by plants in arid environments is investigated this novel and widespread form of biomineralization has unexpected consequences on c cycling and calcite accumulation in areas with large numbers of cacti the magnitude of this mineralization is revealed by studying the large columnar cactus carnegiea gigantea engelm britton and rose in southwestern arizona locally called the saguaro a large c gigantea contains on the order of x g of the ca oxalate weddellite cac o h o in areas with high c gigantea density there is an estimated g catm m sequestered in ca oxalates following the death of the plant the weddellite transforms to calcite on the order to years in areas with high saguaro density there is an estimated release of up to g calcite m year onto the desert soil similar transformation mechanisms occur with the ca oxalates that are abundant in the majority of cacti thus the total atmospheric c returned to the soil of areas with a high number density of cacti is large suggesting that there may be a significant long term accumulation of atmospheric c in these soils derived from ca oxalate biominerals these findings demonstrate that plant decay in arid environments may have locally significant impacts on the ca and inorganic c cycles
the pupils and optical systems of gecko eyes ||||| the nocturnal helmet gecko tarentola chazaliae discriminates colors in dim moonlight when humans are color blind the sensitivity of the helmet gecko eye has been calculated to be times higher than human cone vision at the color vision threshold the optics and the large cones of the gecko are important reasons why they can use color vision at low light intensities using photorefractometry and an adapted laboratory hartmann shack wavefront sensor of high resolution we also show that the optical system of the helmet gecko has distinct concentric zones of different refractive powers a so called multifocal optical system the intraspecific variation is large but in most of the individuals studied the zones differed by diopters this is of the same magnitude as needed to focus light of the wavelength range to which gecko photoreceptors are most sensitive we compare the optical system of the helmet gecko to that of the diurnal day gecko phelsuma madagascariensis grandis the optical system of the day gecko shows no signs of distinct concentric zones and is thereby monofocal
the echinoderm collagen fibril a hero in the connective tissue research of the s ||||| collagen fibrils are some of the most abundant and important extracellular structures in our bodies yet we are unsure of their shape and size this is largely due to an inherent difficulty in isolating them from their surrounding tissues echinoderms have collagenous tissues that are similar to ours in many ways yet they can be manipulated to easily relinquish their collagen fibrils providing an excellent opportunity to study native fibrillar structure in the early s they were found to defy the commonly accepted fibrillar model of the time in that they were much shorter they were shaped like double ended spindles and their centers exhibited a reversal in molecular polarity realization of these features helped to reform the questions that were being asked about vertebrate fibrils shifting the focus toward shape and size since then researchers working with both groups echinoderms and vertebrates have worked together to find the structure of native fibrils this information will be fundamental in understanding what holds collagenous tissues together at the fibrillar level and could have important implications for people with ehlers danlos syndrome bioessays c wiley periodicals inc
cleaving c hg bonds two thiolates are better than one ||||| organomercurial lyase merb catalyzes the difficult cleavage of c hg bonds to hydrocarbon and mercuric dithiol products model compounds providing two or three thiolate ligands activate organomercurials toward acidic cleavage under mild conditions which supports a mechanism in which merb enzymes use two conserved active site cysteines to activate the substrate
sag mediated modulated tension in terebellid tentacles exposed to flow ||||| the long compliant feeding tentacles of the terebellid polychaete eupolymnia heterobranchia not only stretch out over a sandflat substratum but also extend into flow tentacles suspended perpendicular to flow responded to increasing velocity by increasing their sag an analysis of tension in these tentacles mathematically analogous to that applicable to suspension bridges shows that sagging permits the tentacles to avoid increases in tension that would otherwise occur as flow increases force modulation was achieved by active muscular control rather than by passive material properties although these tentacles would certainly break in the experimental flows if they did not sag the low tension achieved suggests that some other reason such as limitations on the adherence of cilia and mucus accounts for the level of tension observed because drag is maximum on tentacles oriented perpendicular to flow reorientation of tentacles either by sagging or by dangling parallel to flow additionally reduces tension by reducing drag theoretical estimates of drag on tentacles oriented parallel to flow show that they are never in danger of being broken drag is sufficient however to assist in passive extension of tentacles while reorientation is a common mode of drag reduction among marine organisms sagging represents a novel mechanism of mediating structural forces resulting from flow
keeping cool enhanced optical reflection and radiative heat dissipation in saharan silver ants ||||| keeping cool silver ants inhabit one of the hottest and driest environments on earth the saharan sands where most insects shrivel and die moments after contact shi et al show that the triangular shape of the silver hairs that cover their bodies enables this existence the hairs both increase the reflection of near infrared rays and dissipate heat from the ants bodies even under full sun conditions evolution s simple solution to intense heat management in this species could lead to better designs for passive cooling of human produced objects science this issue p silver hairs on saharan ants facilitate both reflection and dissipation of intense heat saharan silver ants cataglyphis bombycina forage under extreme temperature conditions in the african desert we show that the ants conspicuous silvery appearance is created by a dense array of triangular hairs with two thermoregulatory effects they enhance not only the reflectivity of the ant s body surface in the visible and near infrared range of the spectrum where solar radiation culminates but also the emissivity of the ant in the mid infrared the latter effect enables the animals to efficiently dissipate heat back to the surroundings via blackbody radiation under full daylight conditions this biological solution for a thermoregulatory problem may lead to the development of biomimetic coatings for passive radiative cooling of objects
microbial ecology meets electrochemistry electricity driven and driving communities ||||| bio electrochemical systems bess have recently emerged as an exciting technology in a bes bacteria interact with electrodes using electrons which are either removed or supplied through an electrical circuit the most described type of bes is microbial fuel cells mfcs in which useful power is generated from electron donors as for example present in wastewater this form of charge transport known as extracellular electron transfer was previously extensively described with respect to metals such as iron and manganese the importance of these interactions in global biogeochemical cycles is essentially undisputed a wide variety of bacteria can participate in extracellular electron transfer and this phenomenon is far more widespread than previously thought the use of bess in diverse research projects is helping elucidate the mechanism by which bacteria shuttle electrons externally new forms of interactions between bacteria have been discovered demonstrating how multiple populations within microbial communities can co operate to achieve energy generation new environmental processes that were difficult to observe or study previously can now be simulated and improved via bess whereas pure culture studies make up the majority of the studies performed thus far even greater contributions of bess are expected to occur in natural environments and with mixed microbial communities owing to their versatility unmatched level of control and capacity to sustain novel processes bess might well serve as the foundation of a new environmental biotechnology while highlighting some of the major breakthroughs and addressing only recently obtained data this review points out that despite rapid progress many questions remain unanswered
ionic compensation with no renal response to chronic hypercapnia in chrysemys picta bellii ||||| the ionic compensatory response to co breathing for days was studied on intact and cystectomized turtles at and degrees c arterial blood gases ph ionized calcium and the plasma concentrations of na k cl total ca and total mg were measured periodically at degrees c ureteral urine was also collected from bladderless turtles and was analyzed for ph ions nh total co osmolality and titratable acid when co was breathed there was a compensatory change in the strong ion difference as manifest by an increase in plasma hco that was approximately meq l both in the and degrees c turtles the only significant associated strong ion changes observed consistent with the ionic compensatory response were increases in total and ionized ca and total mg these results were unaffected at either temperature by surgical removal of the urinary bladder urine collected from cystectomized turtles showed no compensatory increase in acid excretion during hypercapnia in fact changes occurred in the opposite direction urinary excretion of hco and urine ph increased significantly whereas titratable acidity decreased significantly no significant change occurred in ammonia excretion over the three days of hypercapnia these data argue against compensatory roles for the kidneys and urinary bladder in this species and point to internal ionic exchanges involving bone and shell
from eye spots to eye shine ||||| in the marginalia of darwin s on the origin of species the author s spouse wondered if indeed an eye could possibly evolve since it is so complex others more recently have asked the same question fortunately similar doubt did not afflict darwin a review of the evolutionary evidence reveals ample evidence that eyes can and do evolve for example there are creatures that have multiple and very specific eyes suggesting that eyes are not only rather easy to evolve but in some creatures ocular evolution can be quite rapid the process of organism photoreception probably started shortly after life began on this planet stimulated by the sun ocular evolution responded to the sun s energy by producing phototaxis leading to crude eye spots then ascending to the complex and elegant ocular structure of certain birds having two foveae and asymmetric lenses for precise focusing fantastic adaptations often beyond imagination have occurred and are with us today including irregularly shaped eyes and special photopigments to view ultraviolet infrared and bioluminescence the extension of the interpretation of electromagnetic waves into realms we cannot understand must create a fantastic panoply of colours and stimulations and yet as ophthalmologists we rarely consider that any visual system is significantly better than or even that different from our own this is folly for many species have evolved spectacular and stunning adaptations to the visual imperatives of their world the crepuscular aerial drama of a swallow on the wing hunting for a small erratic insect illustrates the profoundly complex visual processing necessary to provide identification tracking pursuit and eventual capture in a dimly lit and almost clueless three dimensional environment yet a swallow does this hundreds of times a day similarly a bathypelagic piscine predator living at a depth of metres must face staggering problems merely identifying
scale dependent trait correlations in a temperate tree community ||||| recent investigations of relationships among plant traits have generated important insights into plant form and function however relationships involving leaf area leaf shape and plant height remain poorly resolved previous work has also focused on correlations between average trait values for individual species it is unclear whether similar relationships occur within species we searched for novel plant trait correlations by comparing leaf area leaf circularity specific leaf area sla and plant height among common woody plant species from a temperate forest in new zealand analyses were conducted both within species intra specifically and among species inter specifically to determine whether trait correlations were scale dependent leaf area was unrelated to other leaf traits inter specifically however leaf area declined with plant height and increased with sla intra specifically leaf circularity decreased with plant height inter specifically but increased with plant height intra specifically sla increased with plant height both inter and intra specifically leaf circularity increased with sla inter specifically but decreased with sla intra specifically overall results showed that leaf shape sla and plant height are interrelated however intra specific relationships often differed substantially from inter specific rela tionships suggesting that the processes shaping relationships between this suite of plant traits are scale dependent
impact of engineered surface microtopography on biofilm formation of staphylococcus aureus ||||| the surface of an indwelling medical device can be colonized by human pathogens that can form biofilms and cause infections in most cases these biofilms are resistant to antimicrobial therapy and eventually necessitate removal or replacement of the device an engineered surface microtopography based on the skin of sharks sharklet aftm has been designed on a poly dimethyl siloxane elastomer pdmse to disrupt the formation of bacterial biofilms without the use of bactericidal agents the sharklet aftm pdmse was tested against smooth pdmse for biofilm formation of staphylococcus aureus over the course of days the smooth surface exhibited early stage biofilm colonies at days and mature biofilms at days while the topographical surface did not show evidence of early biofilm colonization until day at days the mean value of percent area coverage of s aureus on the smooth surface was compared to for the sharklet aftm surface p these results suggest that surface modification of indwelling medical devices and exposed sterile surfaces with the sharklet aftm engineered topography may be an effective solution in disrupting biofilm formation of s aureus
sea urchin spawning in benthic boundary layers are eggs fertilized before advecting away from females ||||| past work on fertilization in echinoids and other egg broadcasting free spawning invertebrates suggests that these organisms might be extremely sperm limited in the field unless individuals spawn in close proximity and under nearly ideal flow conditions however virtually all previous experiments have used one or more techniques surrogates for males and females and short sampling duration that bypassed two potentially important aspects of echinoid reproductive biology the release of gametes in viscous fluids that cling to tests and spines and extended longevity of eggs and undiluted sperm we hypothesized that these attributes might interact with some flow regimes to facilitate time integrated fertilization consequently we explored fertilization processes in sea urchins induced to spawn in a benthic boundary layer in a flow through flume with a male m upstream of a female our observations and data suggest that at free stream flow velocities of and cm s gametes were slowly and continually advected from the aboral surfaces of spawning animals eggs on the surface of the aboral mass were often fertilized before they ablated from the surface many advected eggs were fertilized after being trapped in the vortex downstream of the female gamete advection and fertilization continued for several hours with the actual time course depending on flow velocity fertilization levels declined only slightly with increasing flow velocity these results suggest that fertilization in echinoderms and other free spawners with viscous long lived gametes could be much less sperm limited than currently envisioned and have additional implications for population dynamics and selection on gamete characteristics
comparison of the structure and mechanical properties of bovine femur bone and antler of the north american elk cervus elaphus canadensis ||||| antler and limb bone have a similar microstructure and chemical composition both are primarily composed of type i collagen and a mineral phase carbonated apatite arranged in osteons in compact cortical bone sections and a lamellar structure in the cancellous spongy or trabecular bone sections the mineral content is lower in antler bone and it has a core of cancellous bone surrounded by compact bone running through the main beam and tines the mineral content is higher in the compact compared with the cancellous bone although there is no difference in ratios of the mineral elements with calcium mechanical tests bend and compression on longitudinal and transverse orientations of dry and rehydrated compact bone of north american elk cervus elaphus canadensis antlers are compared with known data on other antlers as well as bovine femora both dry and rehydrated bones are highly anisotropic with the bending and compressive strength and elastic modulus higher in the longitudinal than in the transverse direction there is no significant difference between the bend strength and elastic modulus between dry and rehydrated samples tested in the transverse direction the elastic modulus measured from the bending tests is compared with composite models the elastic modulus and bend strengths are lower in the rehydrated condition but the strain to failure and fracture toughness is much higher compared with dry samples all antler bone mechanical properties are lower than that of bovine femora the antler has a much higher fracture toughness compared with bovine femora which correlates with their main function in intraspecific combat as a high impact resistant energy absorbent material a model of compression deformation is proposed which is based on osteon sliding during shear
ultrastructure and permeability characteristics of the membranes of mucous granules of the hagfish ||||| mucous granules secreted by the slime glands of the hagfish eptatretus stouti were studied after ultrarapid cryofixation and freeze substitution in diverse media osmium tetroxide in acetone several aqueous glutaraldehyde based media with or without osmium only freeze substitution with osmium tetroxide acetone preserved the granules intact allowing visualization of its single unit membrane tests of the rupture or stability of freshly secreted mucous granules in sea water and other aqueous media showed the membranes of the granules are permeable to all inorganic cations tested ranging in relative mass from ammonium to barium they are permeable to the univalent anions chloride nitrate and bicarbonate but not to the di or trivalent anions sulfate phosphate and citrate moreover in solutions where nonpenetrant anions were present rupture occurred if the osmotic pressure was below a critical level about mosmol l the structural and permeability characteristics of the granules account for the explosive speed with which they rupture releasing their mucous contents on contact with sea water
surface tension prey transport in shorebirds how widespread is it ||||| surface tension prey transport is a feeding mechanism employing the surface tension of water surrounding prey to transport prey from bill tip to mouth previously it has been demonstrated only in the red necked phalarope phalaropus lobatus on the basis of a model of the bill morphology necessary for this method of prey transport i suggest that many species of shorebird should be capable of surface tension feeding laboratory investigations of the feeding mechanics of wilson s phalarope phalaropus tricolor western sandpiper calidris mauri and least sandpiper calidris minutilla demonstrated that all three use surface tension transport of prey when feeding in water i examined interspecific variation in the performance of this feeding mechanism with a high speed video system and a customized motion analysis system exploratory analyses indicated significant interspecific variation in distance the prey is transported per cycle of mandibular spreading gape increase per unit transport speed of transport total number of cycles necessary to complete transport and total time to complete transport the calidrid sandpipers also occasionally used other feeding mechanisms in conjunction with surface tension transport of prey the discovery that these sandpipers which normally obtain prey by probing are capable of surface tension transport of prey implies that the capacity to employ this feeding mechanism may be widespread in the scolopacidae and may have been a significant factor in the evolutionary radiation of phalaropes into aquatic environments
pointillist structural color in pollia fruit ||||| biological communication by means of structural color has existed for at least million years structural color is commonly observed in the animal kingdom but has been little studied in plants we present a striking example of multilayer based strong iridescent coloration in plants in the fruit of pollia condensata the color is caused by bragg reflection of helicoidally stacked cellulose microfibrils that form multilayers in the cell walls of the epicarp we demonstrate that animals and plants have convergently evolved multilayer based photonic structures to generate colors using entirely distinct materials the bright blue coloration of this fruit is more intense than that of any previously described biological material uniquely in nature the reflected color differs from cell to cell as the layer thicknesses in the multilayer stack vary giving the fruit a striking pixelated or pointillist appearance because the multilayers form with both helicoidicities optical characterization reveals that the reflected light from every epidermal cell is polarized circularly either to the left or to the right a feature that has never previously been observed in a single tissue
an acidic matrix protein pif is a key macromolecule for nacre formation ||||| making mother of pearl nacre is an iridescent layer of calcium carbonate lining the inside of shells of marine mollusks and is commonly known as mother of pearl it is composed of layers of uniformly oriented crystals of aragonite a metastable form of calcium carbonate separated by layers of organic matrix how the ordered structure of aragonite layers is achieved has been unclear suzuki et al p published online august see the perspective by kroger identified two acidic matrix proteins pif and pif that regulate nacre formation in the japanese pearl oyster the proteins appear to form a complex in which pif binds to aragonite and pif binds to other macromolecules in the organic matrix a matrix protein is identified that regulates nacre formation in the japanese pearl oyster the mollusk shell is a hard tissue consisting of calcium carbonate crystals and an organic matrix the nacre of the shell is characterized by a stacked compartment structure with a uniformly oriented c axis of aragonite crystals in each compartment using a calcium carbonate binding assay we identified an acidic matrix protein pif in the pearl oyster pinctada fucata that specifically binds to aragonite crystals the pif complementary dna cdna encoded a precursor protein which was posttranslationally cleaved to produce pif and pif the results from immunolocalization a knockdown experiment that used rna interference and in vitro calcium carbonate crystallization studies strongly indicate that pif regulates nacre formation
taste perception in honeybees just a taste of honey ||||| the advent of the genomic era has opened new doors to understand the fundamental organization of living organisms and has therefore promoted a fertile field of comparative research that intends to identify similarities and differences between related and unrelated species at the genomic level one of the organisms whose genome has been recently decoded is that of the honeybee apis mellifera enabling a direct comparison with another well studied insect the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster it was reported that the honeybee has only ten gustatory receptors and thus a very poor taste perception compared to drosophila which presents gustatory receptors and the mosquito anopheles gambiae which presents gustatory receptors in this forum article we discuss the implications of these findings taking into account previous and new discoveries on honeybee gustation based on behavioral and neurobiological studies by several authors and us we conclude that the world of taste of a honeybee might not be as poor as proposed and that further studies should integrate molecular neurobiological behavioral and ecological approaches to better characterize taste perception in bees
desiccation resistance of adhesive secretion in the protocarnivorous plant roridula gorgonias as an adaptation to periodically dry environment ||||| to analyse the change of mass in the resinous secretion of roridula gorgonias we carried out long term measurements using a computerised ultra microbalance in contrast to the aqueous mucilage of other carnivorous flypaper traps this water insoluble secretion does not desiccate even in dead and formalin preserved plants we found no significant desiccation of secretory drops within h of continuous weighing after days of the secretion exposure to dry conditions only about of the mass was lost interestingly returning these samples to humid conditions resulted in a mass recovery to the initial amount this property of the secretion is discussed as an ecological adaptation to the periodically dry fynbos habitat of the plant
nanoscale chemical tomography of buried organic inorganic interfaces in the chiton tooth ||||| biological organisms possess an unparalleled ability to control the structure and properties of mineralized tissues they are able for example to guide the formation of smoothly curving single crystals or tough lightweight self repairing skeletal elements in many biominerals an organic matrix interacts with the mineral as it forms controls its morphology and polymorph and is occluded during mineralization the remarkable functional properties of the resulting composites such as outstanding fracture toughness and wear resistance can be attributed to buried organic inorganic interfaces at multiple hierarchical levels analysing and controlling such interfaces at the nanometre length scale is critical also in emerging organic electronic and photovoltaic hybrid materials however elucidating the structural and chemical complexity of buried organic inorganic interfaces presents a challenge to state of the art imaging techniques here we show that pulsed laser atom probe tomography reveals three dimensional chemical maps of organic fibres with a diameter of nm in the surrounding nano crystalline magnetite fe o mineral in the tooth of a marine mollusc the chiton chaetopleura apiculata remarkably most fibres co localize with either sodium or magnesium furthermore clustering of these cations in the fibre indicates a structural level of hierarchy previously undetected our results demonstrate that in the chiton tooth individual organic fibres have different chemical compositions and therefore probably different functional roles in controlling fibre formation and matrix mineral interactions atom probe tomography is able to detect this chemical structural heterogeneity by virtue of its high three dimensional spatial resolution and sensitivity across the periodic table we anticipate that the quantitative analysis and visualization of nanometre scale interfaces by laser pulsed atom probe tomography will contribute greatly to our understanding not only of biominerals such as bone dentine and enamel but also of synthetic organic inorganic composites
do desert ants smell the scenery in stereo ||||| desert ants cataglyphis fortis navigate individually in the inhospitable saltpans of tunisia using path integration for long distance navigation and visual and olfactory landmarks for fine scale orientation in the vicinity of the nest entrance here we show in a field experiment that the ants are able to locate the nest entrance within a two dimensional olfactory array ants were trained to forage in an open channel and to memorize the nest entrance relative to four odours that were applied at the corners of an invisible quadratic array in a test situation the ants pinpointed the fictive nest only when the odours were present at their learned positions our results suggest that the ants had learned the olfactory scenery around their nest furthermore unilaterally antennectomized ants could not pinpoint the nest within a two dimensional array hence this kind of orientation depends on the simultaneous input of both antennae that is on a stereo sense of smell until now insects and mammals including humans have only been known to use bilateral sensory input to follow a concentration gradient of an odour our evidence suggests that desert ants require a stereo sense of smell to make use of the olfactory scenery around their nest for homing
bill sweeping in the spoonbill platalea leucordia evidence for a hydrodynamic function ||||| abstract abstract spoonbills aves platalea spp ciconiiformes characteristically feed by wading in shallow water and rhythmically sweeping their submerged and partially opened bills in an arc this bill sweeping contrasts with the direct grasp strike or stab employed by related species storks ciconiidae herons ardeidae for similar prey crustaceans fish a related feature of spoonbills is the shape of the bill both upper and lower mandibles are dorso ventrally flattened the upper mandible being convex in cross section while the lower is tucked in to result in an almost flat surface the bill is wide throughout and broadens at the distal end the hypothesis presented here is that spoonbills use their broad flattened bills and lateral sweeping to shed a vortex off the tip of the bill that results in hydrodynamic suction on the bottom which disturbs and moves prey to achieve this the bill is used as a hydrofoil the analysis predicts and experimental results show that in feeding the tip of the bill is kept close to the bottom there is an inverse relationship between bill immersion depth and sweeping speed and bill sweeping over submerged prey results in the prey being lifted into the water column this is the first reported case of an avian bill being used as a hydrofoil
protein oxidation implicated as the primary determinant of bacterial radioresistance ||||| in the hierarchy of cellular targets damaged by ionizing radiation ir classical models of radiation toxicity place dna at the top yet many prokaryotes are killed by doses of ir that cause little dna damage here we have probed the nature of mn facilitated ir resistance in deinococcus radiodurans which together with other extremely ir resistant bacteria have high intracellular mn fe concentration ratios compared to ir sensitive bacteria for in vitro and in vivo irradiation we demonstrate a mechanistic link between mn ii ions and protection of proteins from oxidative modifications that introduce carbonyl groups conditions that inhibited mn accumulation or mn redox cycling rendered d radiodurans radiation sensitive and highly susceptible to protein oxidation x ray fluorescence microprobe analysis showed that mn is globally distributed in d radiodurans but fe is sequestered in a region between dividing cells for a group of phylogenetically diverse ir resistant and ir sensitive wild type bacteria our findings support the idea that the degree of resistance is determined by the level of oxidative protein damage caused during irradiation we present the case that protein rather than dna is the principal target of the biological action of ir in sensitive bacteria and extreme resistance in mn accumulating bacteria is based on protein protection
plant biomechanics high endurance algae ||||| breaking waves place repeated loading on marine algae which can lead to death by fatigue but observations of one alga suggest that its joint structure which lacks transverse connections confers fatigue resistance
spray aiming in the bombardier beetle photographic evidence ||||| bombardier beetles when physically assaulted eject a hot quinonoid spray from the tip of the abdomen photographic evidence is presented demonstrating that the african bombardier beetle stenaptinus insignis can aim its spray in virtually any direction it can target its individual legs and even the individual segments of its legs moreover in aiming at a leg it takes into account the postural orientation of that leg the beetle is able even to target sites on its back it is postulated that the ability to aim helps the beetle mainly in defense against ants
anatomical significance of the hygrochastic movement in anastatica hierochuntica ||||| background and aims unlike the dispersal mechanisms of many desert plants the whole dead skeleton of anastatica hierochuntica is involved in seed dispersal and preservation this process depends on the hygrochastic nature of the lignified conducting tissue that bends when dry and straightens under wet conditions an anatomical interpretation of this mechanical movement was investigated methods an anatomical study of the stem was conducted on the juvenile plants raised under different water treatments and on the branch orders of adult a hierochuntica size classes key results in the juvenile stem of a hierochuntica the area of cortex conducting tissue and pith increased with water availability however the hydraulic conductance decreased resulting in a better withdrawal of water in water stressed plants the anatomical investigation of the hygrochastic mechanism revealed an asymmetric distribution of the cortical tissues with the conducting tissues of the stem of juvenile and adult plants being larger in the lower side the hydraulic conductance was better in the basal and middle branch orders than the terminal ones permitting better conductance of water to the subsequent branch orders conclusions the lignified conducting tissue of the whole stem having a hygrochastic nature controls the movement of the branches the greater amount of conducting tissue associated with a higher density of wide xylem vessels was observed in the lower side of the stem as compared with the upper side consequently the conducting tissue in the lower side of the stem was suggested to be more effective in the opening process of the curled dry branches through better and more rapid conductance of water alternatively due to the few narrow xylem vessels in the upper side of the stem it was likely that the conducting tissue in the upper side is more effective in the closing process by providing more rapid drying the mechanical rise of water and the related hygrochastic efficiency were maximized in the basal and middle branch orders that are mostly involved in the mechanical movement
spatial vision in the echinoid genus echinometra ||||| summary although eyes are generally considered necessary for image resolution a diffuse photoreceptive system with directional sensitivity may also have this ability two species of the echinoid genus echinometra were tested for spatial vision by examining their ability to locate and move towards targets of different sizes the echinoids were significantly oriented p towards a target with an angular width of deg sr but were not oriented to targets with angular widths of deg and deg this ability is probably due to the blocking of off angle light by the spines which have approximately the correct spacing for the observed resolution spatial vision is advantageous for echinoids of this genus because they leave and return to small dark shelters this first demonstration of spatial vision in an echinoderm sheds further light on the complex optical structures and photobehaviors found in this phylum
direct uptake of soil nitrogen by mosses ||||| mosses are one of the most diverse and widespread groups of plants and often form the dominant vegetation in montane boreal and arctic ecosystems however unlike higher plants mosses lack developed root and vascular systems which is thought to limit their access to soil nutrients here we test the ability of two physiologically and taxonomically distinct moss species to take up soil and wet deposition derived nitrogen n in natural intact turfs using stable isotopic techniques n both species exhibited increased concentrations of shoot n when exposed to either soil or wet deposition derived n demonstrating conclusively and for the first time that mosses derive n from the soil given the broad physiological and taxonomic differences between these moss species we suggest soil n uptake may be common among mosses although further studies are required to test this prediction soil n uptake by moss species may allow them to compete for soil n in a wide range of ecosystems moreover since many terrestrial ecosystems are n limited soil n uptake by mosses may have implications for plant community structure and nutrient cycling finally soil n uptake may place some moss species at greater risk from n pollution than previously appreciated
stabilization and swelling of hagfish slime mucin vesicles ||||| summary when agitated atlantic hagfish myxine glutinosa produce large quantities of slime that consists of hydrated bundles of protein filaments and membrane bound mucin vesicles from numerous slime glands when the slime exudate contacts seawater the thread bundles unravel and the mucin vesicles swell and rupture little is known about the mechanisms of vesicle rupture in seawater and stabilization within the gland although it is believed that the vesicle membrane is permeable to most ions except polyvalent anions we hypothesized that the most abundant compounds within the slime gland exudate have a stabilizing effect on the mucin vesicles to test this hypothesis we measured the chemical composition of the fluid component of hagfish slime exudate and conducted functional assays with these solutes to test their ability to keep the vesicles in a condensed state we found k concentrations that were elevated relative to plasma and na cl and ca concentrations that were considerably lower our analysis also revealed high levels of methylamines such as trimethylamine oxide tmao betaine and dimethylglycine which had a combined concentration of mmol l in the glandular fluid in vitro rupture assays demonstrated that both tmao and betaine had a significant effect on rupture but neither was capable of completely abolishing mucin swelling and rupture even at high concentrations this suggests that some other mechanism such as the chemical microenvironment within gland mucous cells or hydrostatic pressure is responsible for stabilization of the vesicles within the gland
deciphering the rhizosphere microbiome for disease suppressive bacteria ||||| a common plant pathogen induces the growth of disease suppressive microbes in local soil communities disease suppressive soils are exceptional ecosystems in which crop plants suffer less from specific soil borne pathogens than expected owing to the activities of other soil microorganisms for most disease suppressive soils the microbes and mechanisms involved in pathogen control are unknown by coupling phylochip based metagenomics of the rhizosphere microbiome with culture dependent functional analyses we identified key bacterial taxa and genes involved in suppression of a fungal root pathogen more than bacterial and archaeal species were detected with proteobacteria firmicutes and actinobacteria consistently associated with disease suppression members of the g proteobacteria were shown to have disease suppressive activity governed by nonribosomal peptide synthetases our data indicate that upon attack by a fungal root pathogen plants can exploit microbial consortia from soil for protection against infections
biologically inspired humidity sensor based on three dimensional photonic crystals ||||| this letter presents a biomimetic humidity sensor inspired by the humidity dependent color change observed in the cuticle of the hercules beetle a thin film type humidity sensor with nanoporous structures three dimensional photonic crystals mimicking the spongy multilayer in the beetles was designed and fabricated using the colloidal templating method and a hydrophilic surface treatment the visible color of the fabricated humidity sensor changes from blue green to red as the environmental humidity increases the wavelength of reflected light that is predicted by bragg s equation considering the effect of water absorption shows a good agreement with experimental results
non smooth morphologies of typical plant leaf surfaces and their anti adhesion effects ||||| the micromorphologies of surfaces of several typical plant leaves were investigated by scanning electron microscopy sem different non smooth surface characteristics were described and classified the hydrophobicity and anti adhesion of non smooth leaf surfaces were quantitatively measured results show that the morphology of epidermal cells and the morphology and distribution density of epicuticular wax directly affect the hydrophobicity and anti adhesion the surface with uniformly distributed convex units shows the best anti adhesion and the surface with regularly arranged trellis units displays better anti adhesion in contrast the surface with randomly distributed hair units performs relatively bad anti adhesion the hydrophobic models of papilla ciliary and fold setal non smooth surfaces were set up to determine the impacts of geometric parameters on the hydrophobicity this study may provide an insight into surface machine molding and apparent morphology design for biomimetics engineering
walrus ethology i the social role of tusks and applications of multidimensional scaling ||||| social behavior of male pacific walruses odobenus rosmarus l summering i e outside the breeding season on an alaskan hauling ground is described social interaction on land is mostly agonistic visual presentation of tusks and striking with tusks feature prominently in most agonistic interactions vocal communication occurs in a minority of them agonistic interactions are analyzed in r and q approaches with min ssa a fully non metric multidimensional scaling procedure programmed in the guttman lingoes series large body size and long tusks characterize dominant walruses dominants are most frequently aggressive and threatening and least frequently exhibit submissive defensive protective and avoidance behavior subordinate walruses show the opposite trend walruses are bullies individuals strongly disadvantaged in body size or tusk length or both receive numerous strikes and visual threats walruses tend to initiate agonistic interactions with smaller individuals walrus tusks are importa
the functional morphology of the petioles of the banana musa textilis ||||| bananas are among the largest herbs in the world and their lightweight petioles hold up huge leaves this study examined how the petioles manage to achieve adequate rigidity to do this while allowing extensive and reversible reconfiguration in high winds morphological and anatomical examination of the petioles and leaves of musa textilis suggested how these two apparently incompatible abilities are achieved the hollow u shaped section of the petiole and the longitudinal strengthening elements in its outer skin give it adequate rigidity while its ventral curvature help support the leaf without the need for thick lateral veins these features however also allow the petiole to reconfigure by twisting away from the wind while the leaf can fold away in addition two sets of internal structures longitudinal partitions and transverse stellate parenchyma plates help prevent dorsoventral flattening allowing the petiole to flex further away from the wind without buckling these ideas were tested and verified by a range of mechanical tests simple four point bending and torsion tests showed that the petioles are indeed far more compliant in torsion than in bending axial bending tests and crushing tests showed that petioles could be flexed twice as far and were four times as resistant to dorsoventral flattening when intact than when the internal tissue is removed the banana petiole therefore seems to be an excellent example of natural integrated mechanical design
the interaction between plants and bacteria in the remediation of petroleum hydrocarbons an environmental perspective ||||| widespread pollution of terrestrial ecosystems with petroleum hydrocarbons phcs has generated a need for remediation and given that many phcs are biodegradable bio and phyto remediation are often viable approaches for active and passive remediation this review focuses on phytoremediation with particular interest on the interactions between and use of plant associated bacteria to restore phc polluted sites plant associated bacteria include endophytic phyllospheric and rhizospheric bacteria and cooperation between these bacteria and their host plants allows for greater plant survivability and treatment outcomes in contaminated sites bacterially driven phc bioremediation is attributed to the presence of diverse suites of metabolic genes for aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons along with a broader suite of physiological properties including biosurfactant production biofilm formation chemotaxis to hydrocarbons and flexibility in cell surface hydrophobicity in soils impacted by phc contamination microbial bioremediation generally relies on the addition of high energy electron acceptors e g oxygen and fertilization to supply limiting nutrients e g nitrogen phosphorous potassium in the face of excess phc carbon as an alternative the addition of plants can greatly improve bioremediation rates and outcomes as plants provide microbial habitats improve soil porosity thereby increasing mass transfer of substrates and electron acceptors and exchange limiting nutrients with their microbial counterparts in return plant associated microorganisms improve plant growth by reducing soil toxicity through contaminant removal producing plant growth promoting metabolites liberating sequestered plant nutrients from soil fixing nitrogen and more generally establishing the foundations of soil nutrient cycling in a practical and applied sense the collective action of plants and their associated microorganisms is advantageous for remediation of phc contaminated soil in terms of overall cost and success rates for in situ implementation in a diversity of environments mechanistically there remain biological unknowns that present challenges for applying bio and phyto remediation technologies without having a deep prior understanding of individual target sites in this review evidence from traditional and modern omics technologies is discussed to provide a framework for plant microbe interactions during phc remediation the potential for integrating multiple molecular and computational techniques to evaluate linkages between microbial communities plant communities and ecosystem processes is explored with an eye on improving phytoremediation of phc contaminated sites
improved light extraction in the bioluminescent lantern of a photuris firefly lampyridae ||||| a common problem of light sources emitting from an homogeneous high refractive index medium into air is the loss of photons by total internal reflection bioluminescent organisms as well as artificial devices have to face this problem it is expected that life with its mechanisms for evolution would have selected appropriate optical structures to get around this problem at least partially the morphology of the lantern of a specific firefly in the genus photuris has been examined the optical properties of the different parts of this lantern have been modelled in order to determine their positive or adverse effect with regard to the global light extraction we conclude that the most efficient pieces of the lantern structure are the misfit of the external scales which produce abrupt roughness in air and the lowering of the refractive index at the level of the cluster of photocytes where the bioluminescent production takes place
thermoregulation what role for ucps in mammals and birds ||||| mammals and birds are endotherms and respond to cold exposure by the means of regulatory thermogenesis either shivering or non shivering in this latter case waste of cell energy as heat can be achieved by uncoupling of mitochondrial respiration uncoupling proteins which belong to the mitochondrial carrier family are able to transport protons and thus may assume a thermogenic function the mammalian ucp physiological function is now well understood and gives to the brown adipose tissue the capacity for heat generation but is it really the case for its more recently discovered isoforms ucp and ucp additionally whereas more and more evidence suggests that non shivering also exists in birds is the avian ucp also involved in response to cold exposure in this review we consider the latest advances in the field of ucp biology and present putative functions for ucp homologues
drag reduction by air release promotes fast ascent in jumping emperor penguins a novel hypothesis ||||| to jump out of water onto sea ice emperor penguins must achieve sufficient underwa ter speed to overcome the influence of gravity when they leave the water the relevant combination of density and kinematic viscosity of air is much lower than for water injection of air into boundary layers air lubrication has been used by engineers to speed movement of vehicles ships torpedoes through sea water analysis of published and unpublished underwater film leads us to present a hypothesis that free ranging emperor penguins employ air lubrication in achieving high probably maximal underwater speeds mean sd m s prior to jumps here we show evidence that penguins dive to to m with air in their plumage and that this compressed air is released as the birds subsequently ascend whilst maintaining depressed feathers fine bubbles emerge continu ously from the entire plumage forming a smooth layer over the body and generating bubbly wakes behind the penguins in several hours of film of hundreds of penguins none were seen to swim rapidly upwards without bubbly wakes penguins descend and swim horizontally at about m s from simple physical models and calculations presented we hypothesize that a significant proportion of the enhanced ascent speed is due to air lubrication reducing frictional and form drag that buoyancy forces alone cannot explain the observed speeds and that cavitation plays no part in bubble formation
tuning of color contrast signals to visual sensitivity maxima of tree shrews by three bornean highland nepenthes species ||||| three species of nepenthes pitcher plants nepenthes rajah nepenthes lowii and nepenthes macrophylla specialize in harvesting nutrients from tree shrew excreta in their pitchers in all three species nectaries on the underside of the pitcher lid are the focus of the tree shrews attention tree shrews are dichromats with visual sensitivity in the blue and green wavebands all three nepenthes species were shown to produce visual signals in which the underside of the pitcher lid the area of highest nectar production stood out in high contrast to the adjacent area on the pitcher i e was brighter in the blue and green wavebands visible to the tree shrews n rajah showed the tightest degree of tuning notably in the green waveband conversely pitchers of nepenthes burbidgeae a typical insectivorous species sympatric with n rajah did not produce a color pattern tuned to tree shrew sensitivity maxima
the most versatile of all reactive intermediates ||||| the iron ii and oxoglutarate dependent oxygenases catalyze varied oxidative reactions spectroscopic analyses on the catalytic cycle of the chlorinating enzyme cytc reveal the presence of chloride iron iv oxo complexes expanding the scope of chemistry known to be catalyzed by non heme iron oxo species
the high cost of mutualism effects of four species of east african ant symbionts on their myrmecophyte host tree ||||| three recent meta analyses of protective plant ant mutualisms report a surprisingly weak relationship between herbivore protection and measured demographic benefits to ant plants suggesting high tolerance for herbivory substantial costs of ant mediated defense and or benefits that are realized episodically rather than continuously experimental manipulations of protective ant plant associations typically last for less than a year yet virtually all specialized myrmecophytes are long lived perennials for which the costs and benefits of maintaining ant symbionts could accrue at different rates over the host s lifetime to complement long term monitoring studies we experimentally excluded each of four ant symbionts from their long lived myrmecophyte host trees acacia drepanolobium for years ant species varied in their effectiveness against herbivores and in their effects on intermediate term growth and reproduction but the level of herbivore protection provided was a poor predictor of the net impact they had on host trees removal of the three crematogaster species resulted in cumulative gains in host tree growth and or reproduction over the course of the experiment despite the fact that two of those species significantly reduce chronic herbivore damage in contrast although t penzigi is a relatively poor defender the low cost of maintaining this ant symbiont apparently eliminated negative impacts on overall tree growth and reproduction resulting in enhanced allocation to new branch growth by the final census acacia drepanolobium is evidently highly tolerant of herbivory by insects and small browsers and the costs of maintaining crematogaster colonies exceeded the benefits received during the study no experimental trees were killed by elephants but elephant damage was uniquely associated with reduced tree growth and at least one ant species c mimosae strongly deterred elephant browsing we hypothesize that rare but catastrophic damage by elephants may be more important than chronic herbivory in maintaining the costly myrmecophyte habit in this system
environmental genomics reveals a single species ecosystem deep within earth ||||| dna from low biodiversity fracture water collected at kilometer depth in a south african gold mine was sequenced and assembled into a single complete genome this bacterium candidatus desulforudis audaxviator composes of the microorganisms inhabiting the fluid phase of this particular fracture its genome indicates a motile sporulating sulfate reducing chemoautotrophic thermophile that can fix its own nitrogen and carbon by using machinery shared with archaea candidatus desulforudis audaxviator is capable of an independent life style well suited to long term isolation from the photosphere deep within earth s crust and offers an example of a natural ecosystem that appears to have its biological component entirely encoded within a single genome
mechanism kinematic performance and fitness consequences of jumping behavior in entomopathogenic nematodes steinernema spp ||||| the mechanism enabling entomopathogenic nematodes steinernema spp to jump is described jumping performance is measured and the contribution of jumping to host finding is estimated we used the entomopathogenic nematode steinernema carpocapsae as a model species for the genus nematodes jump using a two step process of forming and contracting a loop during loop formation the nematode bends the anterior half of its body until the head region makes contact with the side of the body the two body regions are held fast by the surface tension of the water film covering the nematode when the loop is contracted the body becomes contorted so that the cuticle kinks this extreme bending generates and stores sufficient energy that when the surface tension force is broken the nematode is propelled through the air the nematode mm in length can jump a distance of mm mean sem and a height of mm the contribution of jumping to host finding varies among species and is related to th
the hummingbird tongue is a fluid trap not a capillary tube ||||| hummingbird tongues pick up a liquid calorie dense food that cannot be grasped a physical challenge that has long inspired the study of nectar transport mechanics existing biophysical models predict optimal hummingbird foraging on the basis of equations that assume that fluid rises through the tongue in the same way as through capillary tubes we demonstrate that the hummingbird tongue does not function like a pair of tiny static tubes drawing up floral nectar via capillary action instead we show that the tongue tip is a dynamic liquid trapping device that changes configuration and shape dramatically as it moves in and out of fluids we also show that the tongue fluid interactions are identical in both living and dead birds demonstrating that this mechanism is a function of the tongue structure itself and therefore highly efficient because no energy expenditure by the bird is required to drive the opening and closing of the trap our results rule out previous conclusions from capillarity based models of nectar feeding and highlight the necessity of developing a new biophysical model for nectar intake in hummingbirds our findings have ramifications for the study of feeding mechanics in other nectarivorous birds and for the understanding of the evolution of nectarivory in general we propose a conceptual mechanical explanation for this unique fluid trapping capacity with far reaching practical applications e g biomimetics
comparative jet wake structure and swimming performance of salps ||||| summary salps are barrel shaped marine invertebrates that swim by jet propulsion morphological variations among species and life cycle stages are accompanied by differences in swimming mode the goal of this investigation was to compare propulsive jet wakes and swimming performance variables among morphologically distinct salp species pegea confoederata weelia salpa cylindrica cyclosalpa sp and relate swimming patterns to ecological function using a combination of in situ dye visualization and particle image velocimetry piv measurements we describe properties of the jet wake and swimming performance variables including thrust drag and propulsive efficiency locomotion by all species investigated was achieved via vortex ring propulsion the slow swimming p confoederata produced the highest weight specific thrust t n kg and swam with the highest whole cycle propulsive efficiency ewc the fast swimming w cylindrica had the most streamlined body shape but produced an intermediate weight specific thrust t n kg and swam with an intermediate whole cycle propulsive efficiency ewc weak swimming performance variables in the slow swimming c affinis including the lowest weight specific thrust t n kg and lowest whole cycle propulsive efficiency ewc may be compensated by low energetic requirements swimming performance variables are considered in the context of ecological roles and evolutionary relationships
most fertilizing mouse spermatozoa begin their acrosome reaction before contact with the zona pellucida during in vitro fertilization ||||| to fuse with oocytes spermatozoa of eutherian mammals must pass through extracellular coats the cumulus cell layer and the zona pellucida zp it is generally believed that the acrosome reaction ar of spermatozoa essential for zona penetration and fusion with oocytes is triggered by sperm contact with the zona pellucida therefore in most previous studies of sperm oocyte interactions in the mouse the cumulus has been removed before insemination to facilitate the examination of sperm zona interactions we used transgenic mouse spermatozoa which enabled us to detect the onset of the acrosome reaction using fluorescence microscopy we found that the spermatozoa that began the acrosome reaction before reaching the zona were able to penetrate the zona and fused with the oocyte s plasma membrane in fact most fertilizing spermatozoa underwent the acrosome reaction before reaching the zona pellucida of cumulus enclosed oocytes at least under the experimental conditions we used the incidence of in vitro fertilization of cumulus free oocytes was increased by coincubating oocytes with cumulus cells suggesting an important role for cumulus cells and their matrix in natural fertilization
food and feeding ecology of puffins ||||| this study shows that although annual fluctuations occur in the main prey types of skomer puffins food availability does not appear to limit breeding success most birds found food close to the colony showing peaks of activity early in the day and again in late afternoon and two out of four experimental pairs were able to rear twins though the growth rates of these were less than for single chicks some interesting observations are given on the feeding of the chick and on kleptoparasitism of adults by jackdaws and gulls
optimal design of microfluidic networks using biologically inspired principles ||||| from the earliest of times man has sought to replicate ideas that have evolved naturally in plants and animals understanding and extracting these natural design strategies has opened up a whole new field of research known as biomimetics designs formulated using biologically inspired principles range from novel surface treatments that mimic physiological processes to geometrical optimization for improving the performance of a system in this paper we will show how biomimetic principles based on the laws that govern biological vascular trees can be used to design artificial microfluidic distribution systems the study focuses specifically on microfluidic manifolds composed of constant depth rectangular or trapezoidal sectioned channels as these geometries can readily be fabricated using standard micro fabrication techniques we will show that it is possible to introduce a prescribed element of flow control into the system by carefully selecting the branching parameter that governs the change in channel dimension at each bifurcation
a mechanical analysis of woodpecker drumming and its application to shock absorbing systems ||||| a woodpecker is known to drum the hard woody surface of a tree at a rate of to times per second with a deceleration of g yet with no sign of blackout or brain damage as a model in nature a woodpecker is studied to find clues to develop a shock absorbing system for micromachined devices its advanced shock absorbing mechanism which cannot be explained merely by allometric scaling is analyzed in terms of endoskeletal structures in this analysis the head structures beak hyoid spongy bone and skull bone with cerebrospinal fluid of the golden fronted woodpecker melanerpes aurifrons are explored with x ray computed tomography images and their shock absorbing mechanism is analyzed with a mechanical vibration model and an empirical method based on these analyses a new shock absorbing system is designed to protect commercial micromachined devices from unwanted high g and high frequency mechanical excitations the new shock absorbing system consists of close packed microglasses within two metal enclosures and a viscoelastic layer fastened by steel bolts which are biologically inspired from a spongy bone contained within a skull bone encompassed with the hyoid of a woodpecker in the experimental characterizations using a mm smoothbore air gun this bio inspired shock absorbing system shows a failure rate of for the commercial micromachined devices at g whereas a conventional hard resin method yields a failure rate of thus verifying remarkable improvement in the g force tolerance of the commercial micromachined devices
revisiting the organohalogens associated with samples of brazilian bees eufriesea purpurata ||||| brazilian bees of the species eufriesea purpurata are known to tolerate very high concentrations of ddt as reported in the literature these bees have suffered no harm from as much as mg bee which is in the per cent range of the body weight in individuals of e purpurata were captured as they collected ddt from walls of remote rural houses in brazil reported herein are quantities and identities of ddt ddt metabolites and other organohalogen compounds in four samples of bees stored since the concentrations of ddt sum of p p ddt dde and ddd ranged from to microg bee which is up to twelve fold higher than the ld value of ddt in the honey bee apis mellifera but significantly lower than the no effect concentration in e purpurata enantioselective determination confirmed the presence of racemic o p ddt in the four individual samples gc ecni ms investigation resulted in the detection of low amounts microg bee of pca lindane and chlordane at higher retention times four unknown compounds were detected with a proposed molecular ion at m z a non aromatic hydrocarbon backbone along with the presence of eight chlorine substituents neither the structure nor the origin of these compounds could be determined considering where and when the bees were collected and considering the biology and ecology of the euglossine bees themselves we propose that the four unknowns are natural products and as such are the most highly chlorinated natural compounds yet discovered
genetic control of surface curvature ||||| although curvature of biological surfaces has been considered from mathematical and biophysical perspectives its molecular and developmental basis is unclear we have studied the cinmutant of antirrhinum which has crinkly rather than flat leaves leaves of cin display excess growth in marginal regions resulting in a gradual introduction of negative curvature during development this reflects a change in the shape and the progression of a cell cycle arrest front moving from the leaf tip toward the base cin encodes a tcp protein and is expressed downstream of the arrest front we propose that cin promotes zero curvature flatness by making cells more sensitive to an arrest signal particularly in marginal regions
structural analysis of hydrophobins ||||| hydrophobins are a remarkable class of small cysteine rich proteins found exclusively in fungi they self assemble to form robust polymeric monolayers that are highly amphipathic and play numerous roles in fungal biology such as in the formation and dispersal of aerial spores and in pathogenic and mutualistic interactions the polymeric form can be reversibly disassembled and is able to reverse the wettability of a surface leading to many proposals for nanotechnological applications over recent years the surprising properties of hydrophobins and their potential for commercialization have led to substantial efforts to delineate their morphology and molecular structure in this review we summarize the progress that has been made using a variety of spectroscopic and microscopic approaches towards understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying hydrophobin structure
biomimetic structure design a possible approach to change the brittleness of ceramics in nature ||||| based on the analysis on structure of natural biomaterials two kinds of ceramic composites with high toughness have been designed and prepared one is fibrous monolithic si n bn composite imitating bamboos or trees in structure the other is laminated si n bn composite imitating nacre in structure plastic forming methods including extrusion and roll compaction respectively followed by hot pressed sintering are used to prepare these two materials with particular structures both of the two composites have high values of fracture toughness and work of fracture fracture toughness are mpa m and mpa m respectively for fibrous monolithic and laminated si n bn composites and works of fracture are both more than j m the load displacement curves reveal that these two materials with biomimetic structure exhibit non brittle feature when applied load to fracture through analysis on fractographs of the materials it is revealed that high toughness comes from the synergistic toughening among multi level toughening mechanisms in different scales weak interfaces whiskers and elongated grains toughening in ceramic matrix cells
differences in polysaccharide structure between calcified and uncalcified segments in the coralline calliarthron cheilosporioides corallinales rhodophyta ||||| the articulated coralline calliarthron cheilosporioides manza produces segmented fronds composed of calcified segments intergenicula separated by uncalcified joints genicula which allow fronds to bend and reorient under breaking waves in the wave swept intertidal zone genicula are formed when calcified cells decalcify and restructure to create flexible tissue the present study has identified important differences in the main agaran disaccharidic repeating units b d galp a l galp synthesized by genicular and intergenicular segments based on chemical and spectroscopical analyses we report that genicular cells from c cheilosporioides biosynthesize a highly methoxylated galactan at c position with low levels of branching with xylose side stubs on c of the b d galp units whereas intergenicular segments produce xylogalactans with high levels of xylose and low levels of o methyl b d gal units these data suggest that during genicular development xylosyl branched linked b d galp units present in the xylogalactan backbones from intergenicular walls are mostly replaced by o methyl d galactose units we speculate that this structural shift is a consequence of a putative and specific methoxyl transferase that blocks the xylosylation on c of the linked b d galp units changes in galactan substitutions may contribute to the distinct mechanical properties of genicula and may lend insight into the calcification process in coralline algae
the influence of stochastic behavior on the human threshold of hearing ||||| abstract the inner hair cells in the cochlea perform the crucial task of transforming mechanical sound signals into electrical activity the cochlear nerve fibers code this information and convey it to the brain for further processing this study investigates the performance of the system inner hair cell primary auditory afferent nerve fibers at the physical limit of the mechano electrical transduction for the human auditory frequency range the brownian motion of the hair cell s receptive organelle the hair bundle does not blunt the sensitivity but in fact enlarges especially in frequency regions which are most important for the perception of music and speech via the mechanism of nonlinear stochastic resonance sr the dynamical range of the mechano electrical transduction by at least one order of magnitude the coding efficiency of small sinusoidal hair bundle deflections shows basic properties of the human hearing threshold curve for pure tones and corresponds to experimental results of noise induced tuning curves in mechano receptors in the rat foot furthermore the model explains how altered coding efficiency contributes to pathological changes in the spiking pattern which arise from morphological changes in the hair bundle structure e g in noise induced sensorineural hearing loss of cochlear origin
leaf dynamics self shading and carbon gain in seedlings of a tropical pioneer tree ||||| we examined leaf dynamics and leaf age gradients of photosynthetic capacity and nitrogen concentration in seedlings of the tropical pioneer tree heliocarpus appendiculatus grown in a factorial design under controlled conditions with two levels each of nutrients ambient light light levels incident above the canopy and self shading the gradient of light levels from upper to lower leaves on the shoot correlations among these parameters were examined in order to determine the influence of self shading and the regulation of standing leaf numbers on leaf longevity and its association with leaf photosynthetic capacity leaf longevity and the number of leaves on the main shoot were both reduced in high light while in the low light environment they were reduced in the steeper self shading gradient in high nutrients leaf longevity was reduced whereas leaf number increased leaf initiation rates were higher in the high nutrient treatment but were not influenced by either light treatment maximum light saturated photosynthetic rate on an area basis was greater in the high light and nutrient treatments while the decline in photosynthetic capacity in realtion to leaf position on the shoot was more rapid in high light and in low nutrients leaf longevity was negatively correlated among treatments with initial photosynthetic capacity the leaf position at which photosynthetic capacity was predicted to reach zero was positively correlated with the number of leaves on the shoot supporting the hypothesis that leaf numbers are regulated by patterns of self shading the negative association of longevity and initial photosynthetic capacity apparently arises from different associations among gradients of photosynthetic capacity leaf numbers and leaf initiation rates in relation to light and nutrient availability the simultaneous consideration of age and position of leaves illuminates the role of self shading as an important factor influencing leaf senescence and canopy structure and dynamics
the aerodynamic effects of wing wing interaction in flapping insect wings ||||| summary we employed a dynamically scaled mechanical model of the small fruit fly drosophila melanogaster reynolds number to investigate force enhancement due to contralateral wing interactions during stroke reversal the clap and fling the results suggest that lift enhancement during clap and fling requires an angular separation between the two wings of no more than deg within the limitations of the robotic apparatus the clap and fling augmented total lift production by up to but depended strongly on stroke kinematics the time course of the interaction between the wings was quite complex for example wing interaction attenuated total force during the initial part of the wing clap but slightly enhanced force at the end of the clap phase we measured two temporally transient peaks of both lift and drag enhancement during the fling phase a prominent peak during the initial phase of the fling motion which accounts for most of the benefit in lift production and a smaller peak of force enhancement at the end fling when the wings started to move apart a detailed digital particle image velocimetry dpiv analysis during clap and fling showed that the most obvious effect of the bilateral image wing on flow occurs during the early phase of the fling due to a strong fluid influx between the wings as they separate the dpiv analysis revealed moreover that circulation induced by a leading edge vortex lev during the early fling phase was smaller than predicted by inviscid two dimensional analytical models whereas circulation of lev nearly matched the predictions of weis fogh s inviscid model at late fling phase in addition the presence of the image wing presumably causes subtle modifications in both the wake capture and viscous forces collectively these effects explain some of the changes in total force and lift production during the fling quite surprisingly the effect of clap and fling is not restricted to the dorsal part of the stroke cycle but extends to the beginning of upstroke suggesting that the presence of the image wing distorts the gross wake structure throughout the stroke cycle
epithelial sodium channels enac are uniformly distributed on motile cilia in the oviduct and the respiratory airways ||||| epithelial sodium channels enacs are located on the apical surface of cells and funnel na ions from the lumen into the cell enac function also regulates extracellular fluid volume as water flows across membranes accompanying na ions to maintain osmolarity to examine the sites of expression and intracellular localization of enac we generated polyclonal antibodies against the extracellular domain of human a enac subunit that we expressed in e coli three dimensional d confocal microscopy of immunofluorescence using these antibodies for the first time revealed that enacs are uniformly distributed on the ciliary surface in all epithelial cells with motile cilia lining the bronchus in human lung and female reproductive tract all along the fimbrial end of the fallopian tube the ampulla and rare cells in the uterine glands quantitative analysis indicated that cilia increase cell surface area fold and the amount of enac on cilia is fold higher than on non ciliated cell surface these findings indicate that enac functions as a regulator of the osmolarity of the periciliary fluid bathing the cilia in contrast to enac cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator cftr that channels chloride ions from the cytoplasm to the lumen is located mainly on the apical side but not on cilia the cilial localization of enac requires reevaluation of the mechanisms of action of cftr and other modulators of enac function enac on motile cilia should be essential for diverse functions of motile cilia such as germ cell transport fertilization implantation clearance of respiratory airways and cell migration
desaturation of exhaled air in camels ||||| we have found that camels can reduce the water loss due to evaporation from the respiratory tract in two ways by decreasing the temperature of the exhaled air and by removal of water vapour from this air resulting in the exhalation of air at less than relative humidity r h camels were kept under desert conditions and deprived of drinking water in the daytime the exhaled air was at or near body core temperature while in the cooler night exhaled air was at or near ambient air temperature in the daytime the exhaled air was fully saturated but at night its humidity might fall to approximately r h the combination of cooling and desaturation can provide a saving of water of relative to exhalation of saturated air at body temperature the mechanism responsible for cooling of the exhaled air is a simple heat exchange between the respiratory air and the surfaces of the nasal passageways on inhalation these surfaces are cooled by the air passing over them and on exhalation heat from the exhaled air is given off to these cooler surfaces the mechanism responsible for desaturation of the air appears to depend on the hygroscopic properties of the nasal surfaces when the camel is dehydrated the surfaces give off water vapour during inhalation and take up water from the respiratory air during exhalation we have used a simple mechanical model to demonstrate the effectiveness of this mechanism
using ecosystem engineers as tools in habitat restoration and rewilding beaver and wetlands ||||| potential for habitat restoration is increasingly used as an argument for reintroducing ecosystem engineers beaver have well known effects on hydromorphology through dam construction but their scope to restore wetland biodiversity in areas degraded by agriculture is largely inferred our study presents the first formal monitoring of a planned beaver assisted restoration focussing on changes in vegetation over years within an agriculturally degraded fen following beaver release based on repeated sampling of fixed plots effects are compared to ungrazed exclosures which allowed the wider influence of waterlogging to be separated from disturbance through tree felling and herbivory after years of beaver presence mean plant species richness had increased on average by per plot whilst the cumulative number of species recorded increased on average by heterogeneity measured by dissimilarity of plot composition increased on average by plants associated with high moisture and light conditions increased significantly in coverage whereas species indicative of high nitrogen decreased areas exposed to both grazing and waterlogging generally showed the most pronounced change in composition with effects of grazing seemingly additive but secondary to those of waterlogging our study illustrates that a well known ecosystem engineer the beaver can with time transform agricultural land into a comparatively species rich and heterogeneous wetland environment thus meeting common restoration objectives this offers a passive but innovative solution to the problems of wetland habitat loss that complements the value of beavers for water or sediment storage and flow attenuation the role of larger herbivores has been significantly overlooked in our understanding of freshwater ecosystem function the use of such species may yet emerge as the missing ingredient in successful restoration
attractive and defensive functions of the ultraviolet pigments of a flower hypericum calycinum ||||| the flower of hypericum calycinum which appears uniformly yellow to humans bears a uv pattern presumably visible to insects two categories of pigments flavonoids and dearomatized isoprenylated phloroglucinols dips are responsible for the uv demarcations of this flower flavonoids had been shown previously to function as floral uv pigments but dips had not been demonstrated to serve in that capacity we found the dips to be present in high concentration in the anthers and ovarian wall of the flower suggesting that the compounds also serve in defense indeed feeding tests done with one of the dips hypercalin a showed the compound to be deterrent and toxic to a caterpillar utetheisa ornatrix the possibility that floral uv pigments fulfill both a visual and a defensive function had not previously been contemplated dips may also serve for protection of female reproductive structures in other plants for example in hops humulus lupulus the dips of hops are put to human use as bitter flavoring agents and preservatives in beer
mechanisms of membrane fusion disparate players and common principles ||||| membrane fusion can occur between cells between different intracellular compartments between intracellular compartments and the plasma membrane and between lipid bound structures such as viral particles and cellular membranes in order for membranes to fuse they must first be brought together the more highly curved a membrane is the more fusogenic it becomes we discuss how proteins including snares synaptotagmins and viral fusion proteins might mediate close membrane apposition and induction of membrane curvature to drive diverse fusion processes we also highlight common principles that can be derived from the analysis of the role of these proteins
do western boxelder bugs sunbathe for sanitation inferences from in vitro experiments ||||| when western boxelder bugs boisea rubrolineata barber hemiptera rhopalidae form aggregations in warm sunlight they release from their posterior dorsal abdominal gland an odorous blend of monoterpenes with heretofore unknown biological function in laboratory analyses and experiments we show that bugs in warm sunlight but not in shade exude and spread copious amounts of monoterpenes onto their cuticle these monoterpenes do not serve as a pheromone but rather as a means of sanitation they inhibit germination of conidia of the fungal pathogen beauveria bassiana bals criv vuill hypocreales as well as halt the growth of germinated spores this prophylactic defense against pathogens appears adaptive for phytophagous insects like b rubrolineata that are prone to infections by microbes thriving on leaf surfaces and in the insects overwintering microhabitat
the cellulose system in viscin from mistletoe berries ||||| the cellulose system of the viscous fibrous cellulosic polysaccharide viscan in the viscin tissue of the european mistletoe viscum album l was analyzed by chemical and physicochemical techniques including sugar analysis optical and transmission electron microscopy x ray and electron diffraction together with solid state cp mas c nmr spectroscopy the results confirmed that in the elongated thin viscin cells the cellulose microfibrils having a diameter of around nm were tightly coiled with their axes perpendicular to the long axis of the cell upon stretching these cells became deformed by more than a hundred fold in such a deformation the cellulose microfibrils became unwound to be perfectly aligned along the stretching direction based on solid state cp mas c nmr spectroscopic analysis of the viscin tissue it was found that its cellulose consisted of ia and ib polymorphs in the ratio
bird activity and seed dispersal of a tropical wet forest tree ||||| feeding assemblages of birds were observed throughout a fruiting season at a costa rican population of the rain forest tree casearia corymbosa in order to distinguish effective dispersal agents from visitors which used arils for food without dispersing seeds this system is of special interest because the tree fruits during an annual period of fruit scarcity in a forest characterized by high proportions of animal dispersed plants and obligate frugivores results show that the masked tityra tityra semifasciata is an effective dispersal agent of seeds of this tree because it regurgitates viable seeds is a common and regular visitor throughout the season has high feeding rates removes seeds from the vicinity of the parent tree before processing them and depends on this rather than other plants fruiting at the same time twenty one other visitors were deficient dispersers although some depended heavily on fruit of this tree for food two parrots amazona autumnalis and amazona farinosa preclude dispersal by strip ping arils with their bills and dropping all seeds in situ fourteen species are occasional visitors five visitors ramphastos sulfuratus ramphastos swainsonii pteroglossus torquatus myiozetetes similis and myiozetetes granadensis process seeds undamaged and are sometimes numerically abun dant but are absent part of the season and tend to regurgitate seeds in situ because fruiting activity of this tree occurs during annual scarcity it represents a pivotal species in the community three obligate frugivores including one effective disperser and two fruit thieves depend almost entirely on it for food for periods of wk i hypothesize that extinction of this plant at this site would lead to disappearance of these birds and would almost certainly depress recruitment of other species of trees for which they serve as dispersal agents at other times of the year
conical epidermal cells allow bees to grip flowers and increase foraging efficiency ||||| the plant surface is by default flat and development away from this default is thought to have some function of evolutionary advantage although the functions of many plant epidermal cells have been described the function of conical epidermal cells a defining feature of petals in the majority of insect pollinated flowers has not the location and frequency of conical cells have led to speculation that they play a role in attracting animal pollinators snapdragon antirrhinum mutants lacking conical cells have been shown to be discriminated against by foraging bumblebees here we investigated the extent to which a difference in petal surface structure influences pollinator behavior through touch based discrimination to isolate touch based responses we used both biomimetic replicas of petal surfaces and isogenic antirrhinum lines differing only in petal epidermal cell shape we show that foraging bumblebees are able to discriminate between different surfaces via tactile cues alone we find that bumblebees use color cues to discriminate against flowers that lack conical cells but only when flower surfaces are presented at steep angles making them difficult to manipulate this facilitation of physical handling is a likely explanation for the prevalence of conical epidermal petal cells in most flowering plants
secretion of gases against high pressures in the swimbladder of deep sea fishes ii the rete mirabile ||||| the structure and dimensions are given for the rete mirabile it is interpreted as a counter current diffusion exchange mechanism between the afferent and efferent rete this diffusion exchange has been quantitatively evaluated for o co and n the arrangement makes possible the maintenance of a steep tension gradient within the rete so that the oxygen loss from the leaving blood can be extremely low quantitative evaluation of the efficiency of the rete diffusion makes it clear that the limiting equilibrium pressure in the swimbladder could be extremely high and that the limiting factor lies mainly in the dissociation pressure of the chemical or physical reaction which ultimately splits off the oxygen the nature of the responsible compound and reaction is unknown the anatomical arrangement of the glandular structure and the rete is suggestive of a cellular secretion of oxygen rather than of a mechanism that splits off oxygen in the blood data on the deposition of nitrogen against high
hydromechanics and biology ||||| summaryto exemplify relations between biology and hydrodynamics the reynolds number range and the effects of viscosity and inertia in swimming and flying organisms is discussed comparing water beetles and penguins it is shown that the technical drag coefficient is an adequate means to describe flow adaptation in animals compared to technical systems especially the penguins drag coefficient is astonishingly low furthermore the question why comparatively thick bodies in penguins and dolphins show rather low drag is discussed distributed boundary layer damping in dolphins and secretion of special high molecular slimes in fishes help to keep flow characteristics laminar as an example of one easily understood thrust mechanism the drag inducing pair of rowing legs in water beetles is morphologically and hydrodynamically analysed fish swimming is discussed as a locomotion principle using lift components thrust generation by the moving tail fin of a fish is analysed in detail coming back to the influence if reynolds number it is finally shown how very small bristle bearing swimming legs and wings of insects make use of viscosity effects for locomotion
nuthatches eavesdrop on variations in heterospecific chickadee mobbing alarm calls ||||| many animals recognize the alarm calls produced by other species but the amount of information they glean from these eavesdropped signals is unknown we previously showed that black capped chickadees poecile atricapillus have a sophisticated alarm call system in which they encode complex information about the size and risk of potential predators in variations of a single type of mobbing alarm call here we show experimentally that red breasted nuthatches sitta canadensis respond appropriately to subtle variations of these heterospecific chick a dee alarm calls thereby evidencing that they have gained important information about potential predators in their environment this study demonstrates a previously unsuspected level of discrimination in intertaxon eavesdropping
the splash cup dispersal mechanism in plants ||||| the late prof a h r buller regarded certain cup shaped reproductive bodies found among cryptogams as splash cups which make use of the energy of raindrops for the dispersal of spores sperms and gemmae buller s concepts are presented and supplemented by investigations carried out since his death raindrops cause the peridioles of the nidulariaceae or bird s nest fungi to be thrown about four feet by splash action in the genus cyathus as a peridiole is jerked out of its cup the funiculus is torn and this makes possible the expansion of a mass of adhesive hyphae the hapteron which clings to any object in the line of flight the momentum of the peridiole causes a long cord to be pulled out of a sheath attached to the peridiole the peridiole is checked in flight and the jerk causes the funicular cord to become wound around stems or entangled among plant hairs thus the peridiole becomes attached to vegetation and may be eaten subsequently by herbivorous animals several morphological features of
do epidermal lens cells facilitate the absorptance of diffuse light ||||| many understory plants rely on diffuse light for photosynthesis because direct light is usually scattered by upper canopy layers before it strikes the forest floor there is a considerable gap in the literature concerning the interaction of direct and diffuse light with leaves some understory plants have well developed lens shaped epidermal cells which have long been thought to increase the absorption of diffuse light to assess the role of epidermal cell shape in capturing direct vs diffuse light we measured leaf reflectance and transmittance with an integrating sphere system using leaves with flat begonia erythrophylla citrus reticulata and ficus benjamina and lens shaped epidermal cells b bowerae colocasia esculenta and impatiens velvetea in all species examined more light was absorbed when leaves were irradiated with direct as opposed to diffuse light when leaves were irradiated with diffuse light more light was transmitted and more was reflected in both leaf types resulting in absorptance values lower than in leaves irradiated with direct light these data suggest that lens shaped epidermal cells do not aid the capture of diffuse light palisade and mesophyll cell anatomy and leaf thickness appear to have more influence in the capture and absorption of light than does epidermal cell shape
unusual coloration in scarabaeid beetles ||||| in this paper we investigate the reflection of circularly polarized light from the exocuticle of the scarabaeid beetle gymnopleurus virens reflection spectra are deeply modulated exhibiting a number of relatively narrow well defined peaks which differ from previously studied specimens by comparing model calculations and electron microscopy work with the recorded spectra we can propose the presence of specific structural defects responsible for the unusual spectra
diet effects on honeybee immunocompetence ||||| the maintenance of the immune system can be costly and a lack of dietary protein can increase the susceptibility of organisms to disease however few studies have investigated the relationship between protein nutrition and immunity in insects here we tested in honeybees apis mellifera whether dietary protein quantity monofloral pollen and diet diversity polyfloral pollen can shape baseline immunocompetence ic by measuring parameters of individual immunity haemocyte concentration fat body content and phenoloxidase activity and glucose oxidase gox activity which enables bees to sterilize colony and brood food as a parameter of social immunity protein feeding modified both individual and social ic but increases in dietary protein quantity did not enhance ic however diet diversity increased ic levels in particular polyfloral diets induced higher gox activity compared with monofloral diets including protein richer diets these results suggest a link between protein nutrition and immunity in honeybees and underscore the critical role of resource availability on pollinator health
worms bask in extreme temperatures ||||| temperature is one of the most important environmental factors that governs a species distribution some highly specialized prokaryotes can grow at temperatures above degc ref but eukaryotes appear less versatile and do not normally occur above degc here we show that a colony dwelling polychaete worm inhabiting deep sea hydrothermal vent chimneys regularly experiences temperatures above degc and a thermal gradient of degc or more over its body length
microtubule catastrophe and rescue ||||| microtubules are long cylindrical polymers composed of tubulin subunits in cells microtubules play an essential role in architecture and motility for example microtubules give shape to cells serve as intracellular transport tracks and act as key elements in important cellular structures such as axonemes and mitotic spindles to accomplish these varied functions networks of microtubules in cells are very dynamic continuously remodeling through stochastic length fluctuations at the ends of individual microtubules the dynamic behavior at the end of an individual microtubule is termed dynamic instability this behavior manifests itself by periods of persistent microtubule growth interrupted by occasional switching to rapid shrinkage called microtubule catastrophe and then by switching back from shrinkage to growth called microtubule rescue in this review we summarize recent findings which provide new insights into the mechanisms of microtubule catastrophe and rescue and discuss the impact of these findings in regards to the role of microtubule dynamics inside of cells
biomechanics on the half shell functional performance influences patterns of morphological variation in the emydid turtle carapace ||||| this study uses the carapace of emydid turtles to address hypothesized differences between terrestrial and aquatic species geometric morphometrics are used to quantify shell shape and performance is estimated for two shell functions shell strength and hydrodynamics aquatic turtle shells differ in shape from terrestrial turtle shells and are characterized by lower frontal areas and presumably lower drag terrestrial turtle shells are stronger than those of aquatic turtles many to one mapping of morphology to function does not entirely mitigate a functional trade off between mechanical strength and hydrodynamic performance furthermore areas of morphospace characterized by exceptionally poor performance in either of the functions are not occupied by any emydid species though aquatic and terrestrial species show no significant differences in the rate of morphological evolution aquatic species show a higher lineage density indicative of a greater amount of convergence in their evolutionary history the techniques employed in this study including the modeling of theoretical shapes to assess performance in unoccupied areas of morphospace suggest a framework for future studies of morphological variation
a poisonous surprise under the coat of the african crested rat ||||| plant toxins are sequestered by many animals and the toxicity is frequently advertised by aposematic displays to deter potential predators such unpalatability by appropriation is common in many invertebrate groups and also found in a few vertebrate groups however potentially lethal toxicity by acquisition has so far never been reported for a placental mammal here we describe complex morphological structures and behaviours whereby the african crested rat lophiomys imhausi acquires dispenses and advertises deterrent toxin roots and bark of acokanthera schimperi apocynaceae trees are gnawed masticated and slavered onto highly specialized hairs that wick up the compound to be delivered whenever the animal is bitten or mouthed by a predator the poison is a cardenolide closely resembling ouabain one of the active components in a traditional african arrow poison long celebrated for its power to kill elephants
reorientation of daffodil narcissus amaryllidaceae flowers inwind drag reduction andtorsional flexibility ||||| daffodil flowers extend laterally from the long axes of their stems as a result wind on a flower exerts torsional as well as flexural stress on the stem stems respond by twisting and thus flowers reorient to face downwind in moderate winds in the process reducing their drag by this repositioning is facilitated by the stems relatively low torsional stiffness daffodil stems have a ratio of flexural to torsional stiffness of sd compared with sd for tulip stems which bear flowers as symmetrical extensions of their long axes and compared with for isotropic incompressible circular cylinders
propagation and perception of bioluminescence factors affecting counterillumination as a cryptic strategy ||||| many deep sea species particularly crustaceans cephalopods and fish use photophores to illuminate their ventral surfaces and thus disguise their silhouettes from predators viewing them from below this strategy has several potential limitations two of which are examined here first a predator with acute vision may be able to detect the individual photophores on the ventral surface second a predator may be able to detect any mismatch between the spectrum of the bioluminescence and that of the background light the first limitation was examined by modeling the perceived images of the counterillumination of the squid abralia veranyi and the myctophid fish ceratoscopelus maderensis as a function of the distance and visual acuity of the viewer the second limitation was addressed by measuring downwelling irradiance under moonlight and starlight and then modeling underwater spectra four water types were examined coastal water at a depth of m and oceanic water at and m the appearance of the counterillumination was more affected by the visual acuity of the viewer than by the clarity of the water even at relatively large distances species with high visual acuity deg resolution were able to distinguish the individual photophores of some counterilluminating signals at distances of several meters thus breaking the camouflage depth and the presence or absence of moonlight strongly affected the spectrum of the background light particularly near the surface the increased variability near the surface was partially offset by the higher contrast attenuation at shallow depths which reduced the sighting distance of mismatches this research has implications for the study of spatial resolution contrast sensitivity and color discrimination in deep sea visual systems
biogeochemistry and microbial ecology of methane oxidation in anoxic environments a review ||||| evidence supporting a key role for anaerobic methane oxidation in the global methane cycle is reviewed emphasis is on recent microbiological advances the driving force for research on this process continues to be the fact that microbial communities intercept and consume methane from anoxic environments methane that would otherwise enter the atmosphere anaerobic methane oxidation is biogeochemically important because methane is a potent greenhouse gas in the atmosphere and is abundant in anoxic environments geochemical evidence for this process has been observed in numerous marine sediments along the continental margins in methane seeps and vents around methane hydrate deposits and in anoxic waters the anaerobic oxidation of methane is performed by at least two phylogenetically distinct groups of archaea the anme and anme these archaea are frequently observed as consortia with sulfate reducing bacteria and the metabolism of these consortia presumably involves a syntrophic association based on interspecies electron transfer the archaeal member of a consortium apparently oxidizes methane and shuttles reduced compounds to the sulfate reducing bacteria despite recent advances in understanding anaerobic methane oxidation uncertainties still remain regarding the nature and necessity of the syntrophic association the biochemical pathway of methane oxidation and the interaction of the process with the local chemical and physical environment this review will consider the microbial ecology and biogeochemistry of anaerobic methane oxidation with a special emphasis on the interactions between the responsible organisms and their environment
congruence of epicuticular hydrocarbons and tarsal secretions as a principle in beetles ||||| within beetles those species that are adapted to life on plants have developed widened tarsi with specialised hairy attachment structures the capability to adhere to smooth surfaces is based on a liquid film on the surface of these structures the composition of which is similar to the cuticular lipids by means of a cluster analysis based on chemical similarities between samples obtained from tarsi or elytra of species using solid phase microextraction the present study strongly suggests that this chemical congruence is a principle in beetles this supports the idea of tarsal liquids being part of the cuticular lipid layer and contributes to the understanding of liquid mediated attachment systems
three dimensional flow and lift characteristics of a hovering ruby throated hummingbird ||||| a three dimensional computational fluid dynamics simulation is performed for a ruby throated hummingbird archilochus colubris in hovering flight realistic wing kinematics are adopted in the numerical model by reconstructing the wing motion from high speed imaging data of the bird lift history and the three dimensional flow pattern around the wing in full stroke cycles are captured in the simulation significant asymmetry is observed for lift production within a stroke cycle in particular the downstroke generates about times as much vertical force as the upstroke a result that confirms the estimate based on the measurement of the circulation in a previous experimental study associated with lift production is the similar power imbalance between the two half strokes further analysis shows that in addition to the angle of attack wing velocity and surface area drag based force and wing wake interaction also contribute significantly to the lift asymmetry though the wing wake interaction could be beneficial for lift enhancement the isolated stroke simulation shows that this benefit is buried by other opposing effects e g presence of downwash the leading edge vortex is stable during the downstroke but may shed during the upstroke finally the full body simulation result shows that the effects of wing wing interaction and wing body interaction are small
skin barrier structure and function the single gel phase model ||||| a new model for the structure and function of the mammalian skin barrier is postulated it is proposed that the skin barrier i e the intercellular lipid within the stratum corneum exists as a single and coherent lamellar gel phase this membrane structure is stabilized by the very particular lipid composition and lipid chain length distributions of the stratum corneum intercellular space and has virtually no phase boundaries the intact i e unperturbed single and coherent lamellar gel phase is proposed to be mainly located at the lower half of stratum corneum further up crystalline segregation and phase separation may occur as a result of the desquamation process the single gel phase model differs significantly from earlier models in that it predicts that no phase separation neither between liquid crystalline and gel phases nor between different crystalline phases with hexagonal and orthorhombic chain packing respectively is present in the unperturbed barrier structure the new skin barrier model may explain i the measured water permeability of stratum corneum ii the particular lipid composition of the stratum corneum intercellular space iii the absence of swelling of the stratum corneum intercellular lipid matrix upon hydration and iv the simultaneous presence of hexagonal and orthorhombic hydrocarbon chain packing of the stratum corneum intercellular lipid matrix at physiologic temperatures further the new model is consistent with skin barrier formation according to the membrane folding model of norlen this new theoretical model could fully account for the extraordinary barrier capacity of mammalian skin and is hereafter referred to as the single gel phase model
screening microalgal cultures in search of microbial exopolysaccharides with potential as adhesives ||||| nearly cultures from the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation csiro collection of living microalgae cclm were screened for exopolysaccharide eps production by examining the viscosity of conditioned media supernatants we first established dose response relationships for the viscosity of reference polysaccharides dissolved in microalgal growth media then using the most viscous cclm cultures we confirmed that the viscosity of culture supernatants correlated well with their total sugar and thus eps content the conditioned medium with the highest viscosity cp equivalent to g l xanthan gum was produced by a non axenic isolate of the cyanobacterium microcystis aeruginosa f flos aquae two types of bacteria designated csiro gram positive and csiro gram negative were subcultured from it at dry wt sugar an exopolymer preparation from csiro contained substantially more eps than its counterparts from csiro or from axenic microcystis cultures and it resembled a well known bacterial eps xanthan gum in being much more effective at bonding wood than pvc it bonded wooden lap joints with a dry shear strength of mpa four times the value obtained in equivalent tests of a commercial polyvinyl acetate pva glue
high resolution polarisation vision in a cuttlefish ||||| summary for animals that can see it the polarisation of light adds another dimension to vision analogous to adding colour to a black and white image whilst some animals use the orientation of the electric field vector e vector for navigation and orientation the ability to discriminate angular differences in e vector has been implicated in object recognition for predator prey detection as well as signalling and communication in all animals previously tested however the resolution of e vector angle discrimination has been found to be in the range deg which is inadequate for the typical e vector differences measured in relevant natural visual scenes in this study we found that mourning cuttlefish sepia plangon are able to detect differences between e vector orientations as small as deg not only is this the most acute e vector angle discrimination measured behaviourally in any animal but it provides a high enough resolution to be relevant to real world visual tasks we analysed natural underwater scenes using computer based polarisation imaging when we increased the resolution of our system we discovered information not detected using normal resolution imaging polarimetry and invisible to animals lacking fine e vector angle discrimination for example we found that high resolution e vector discrimination provides a new way of breaking typical intensity based background matching s plangon lacks colour vision like most other cephalopods and high resolution polarisation vision may provide an alternative source of contrast information that is just as fine scale
arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis modulates antioxidant response in salt stressed trigonella foenum graecum plants ||||| an experiment was conducted to evaluate the influence of glomus intraradices colonization on the activity of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase sod catalase cat peroxidase px ascorbate peroxidase apx and glutathione reductase gr and the accumulation of nonenzymatic antioxidants ascorbic acid a tocopherol glutathione and carotenoids in roots and leaves of fenugreek plants subjected to varying degrees of salinity and mm nacl at two time intervals and days after saline treatment dat the antioxidative capacity was correlated with oxidative damage in the same tissue under salt stress lipid peroxidation and h o concentration increased with increasing severity and duration of salt stress dos however the extent of oxidative damage in mycorrhizal plants was less compared to nonmycorrhizal plants the study reveals that mycorrhiza mediated attenuation of oxidative stress in fenugreek plants is due to enhanced activity of antioxidant enzymes and higher concentrations of antioxidant molecules however the significant effect of g intraradices colonization on individual antioxidant molecules and enzymes varied with plant tissue salinity level and dos the significant effect of g intraradices colonization on antioxidative enzymes was more evident at dat in both leaves and roots while the concentrations of antioxidant molecules were significantly influenced at dat it is proposed that am symbiosis can improve antioxidative defense systems of plants through higher sod activity in m plants facilitating rapid dismutation of o to h o and subsequent prevention of h o build up by higher activities of cat apx and px the potential of g intraradices to ameliorate oxidative stress generated in fenugreek plants by salinity was more evident at higher intensities of salt stress
diverse strategies of protein sclerotization in marine invertebrates structure property relationships in natural biomaterials ||||| abstract the conventional wisdom regarding sclerotization in arthropod exoskeletons is that tissue stiffness and polyphenolic content are tightly coupled recent progress on the biochemistry and mechanics of sclerotized structures from non arthropod invertebrates such as mussels polychaetes and squid suggests that this premise is too simple and needs to be more closely scrutinized emerging mechanistic insights about structure property relationships in sclerotized extracellular composites include the following tissue stiffness can be significantly adjusted by the relative organization and density of rigid versus flexible domains in the protein components mussel byssal thread structures can be rich in polyphenols without being sclerotized mussel adhesive plaque stiffness and hardness can be adjusted by the relative abundance of interactions between protein based imidazole and catecholate ligands and transition metals polychaete jaws and mussel cuticle polyphenol derived covalent cross link density in a protein chitin composite offers some stiffening but gains from incrementally controlled dehydration are far greater squid beak and finally protein domains ligand and metal densities covalent cross linking and dehydration are elaborately manipulated to create stiffness gradients between mechanically mismatched tissues

how the venus flytrap snaps ||||| the rapid closure of the venus flytrap dionaea muscipula leaf in about ms is one of the fastest movements in the plant kingdom this led darwin to describe the plant as one of the most wonderful in the world the trap closure is initiated by the mechanical stimulation of trigger hairs previous studies have focused on the biochemical response of the trigger hairs to stimuli and quantified the propagation of action potentials in the leaves here we complement these studies by considering the post stimulation mechanical aspects of venus flytrap closure using high speed video imaging non invasive microscopy techniques and a simple theoretical model we show that the fast closure of the trap results from a snap buckling instability the onset of which is controlled actively by the plant our study identifies an ingenious solution to scaling up movements in non muscular engines and provides a general framework for understanding nastic motion in plants
honey bee nest thermoregulation diversity promotes stability ||||| a honey bee colony is characterized by high genetic diversity among its workers generated by high levels of multiple mating by its queen few clear benefits of this genetic diversity are known here we show that brood nest temperatures in genetically diverse colonies i e those sired by several males tend to be more stable than in genetically uniform ones i e those sired by one male one reason this increased stability arises is because genetically determined diversity in workers temperature response thresholds modulates the hive ventilating behavior of individual workers preventing excessive colony level responses to temperature fluctuations

how swifts control their glide performance with morphing wings ||||| gliding birds continually change the shape and size of their wings presumably to exploit the profound effect of wing morphology on aerodynamic performance that birds should adjust wing sweep to suit glide speed has been predicted qualitatively by analytical glide models which extrapolated the wing s performance envelope from aerodynamic theory here we describe the aerodynamic and structural performance of actual swift wings as measured in a wind tunnel and on this basis build a semi empirical glide model by measuring inside and outside swifts behavioural envelope we show that choosing the most suitable sweep can halve sink speed or triple turning rate extended wings are superior for slow glides and turns swept wings are superior for fast glides and turns this superiority is due to better aerodynamic performance with the exception of fast turns swept wings are less effective at generating lift while turning at high speeds but can bear the extreme loads finally our glide model predicts that cost effective gliding occurs at speeds of m s whereas agility related figures of merit peak at m s in fact swifts spend the night roost in flight at m s ref thus our model can explain this choice for a resting behaviour morphing not only adjusts birds wing performance to the task at hand but could also control the flight of future aircraft
hardness in arthropod exoskeletons in the absence of transition metals ||||| the arthropod cuticle is a remarkable and versatile biological material commonly composed of chitin and proteins lessons can be learned from the way it is adapted to fit its functions the larval jewel beetle pseudotaenia frenchi demonstrates hardness in the cutting edge of the mandibles in excess of the mineralized carapace of stone crabs and compares favourably with some stainless steels yet this is a form of cuticle which is devoid of transition metals or mineralization in seeming contradiction the similarly dark coloured adult beetle mandibles contain the transition metal manganese but are significantly softer energy dispersive x ray analysis and infrared spectroscopy have been used to investigate the differences in composition of mandible cuticle of the adult and larval beetles

nature s moisture harvesters a comparative review ||||| nature has adapted different methods for surviving dry arid xeric conditions it is the focus of this comparative review to pull together the relevant information gleaned from the literature that could be utilized to design moisture harvesting devices informed by biomimetics most water harvesting devices in current use are not informed by nature and those that do are usually based on a biomimetic principle that has been based on one species only this review draws on the published literature to establish a list of species animals vertebrates invertebrates and plants whose habitat is in mainly dry or arid regions and that are known to harvest airborne moisture key findings have been outlined and review comments and discussion set out following this surface feature convergences have been identified namely hexagonal microstructures groove like and cone like geometries this has been coupled with direction of water flow that is driven by surface energy as far as the authors are aware this convergent evolution has not been brought together in this manner before in the future this information could be translated into an engineered device for collecting water from airborne sources
defense by foot adhesion in a beetle hemisphaerota cyanea ||||| the beetle hemisphaerota cyanea chrysomelidae cassidinae responds to disturbance by activating a tarsal adhesion mechanism by which it secures a hold on the substrate its tarsi are oversized and collectively bear some adhesive bristles each with two terminal pads while walking the beetle commits but a small fraction of the bristles to contact with the substrate but when assaulted it presses its tarsi flatly down thereby touching ground with all or nearly all of the bristles once so adhered it can withstand pulling forces of up to g approximately times its body mass for min and of higher magnitudes up to g for shorter periods adhesion is secured by a liquid most probably an oil by adhering the beetle is able to thwart attacking ants given that it is able to cling more persistently than the ant persists in its assault one predator the reduviid arilus cristatus is able to feed on the beetle possibly because by injecting venom it prevents the beetle from maintaining its tarsal hold

bacterial biofilm shows persistent resistance to liquid wetting and gas penetration ||||| most of the world s bacteria exist in robust sessile communities known as biofilms ubiquitously adherent to environmental surfaces from ocean floors to human teeth and notoriously resistant to antimicrobial agents we report the surprising observation that bacillus subtilis biofilm colonies and pellicles are extremely nonwetting greatly surpassing the repellency of teflon toward water and lower surface tension liquids the biofilm surface remains nonwetting against up to ethanol as well as other organic solvents and commercial biocides across a large and clinically important concentration range we show that this property limits the penetration of antimicrobial liquids into the biofilm severely compromising their efficacy to highlight the mechanisms of this phenomenon we performed experiments with mutant biofilms lacking ecm components and with functionalized polymeric replicas of biofilm microstructure we show that the nonwetting properties are a synergistic result of ecm composition multiscale roughness reentrant topography and possibly yet other factors related to the dynamic nature of the biofilm surface finally we report the impenetrability of the biofilm surface by gases implying defense capability against vapor phase antimicrobials as well these remarkable properties of b subtilis biofilm which may have evolved as a protection mechanism against native environmental threats provide a new direction in both antimicrobial research and bioinspired liquid repellent surface paradigms
the incidence and implications of clouds for cloud forest plant water relations ||||| although clouds are the most recognisable and defining feature of tropical montane cloud forests little research has focussed on how clouds affect plant functioning we used satellite and ground based observations to study cloud and leaf wetting patterns in contrasting tropical montane and pre montane cloud forests we then studied the consequences of leaf wetting for the direct uptake of water accumulated on leaf surfaces into the leaves themselves during the dry season the montane forest experienced higher precipitation cloud cover and leaf wetting events of longer duration than the pre montane forest leaf wetting events resulted in foliar water uptake in all species studied the capacity for foliar water uptake differed significantly between the montane and pre montane forest plant communities as well as among species within a forest our results indicate that foliar water uptake is common in these forest plants and improves plant water status during the dry season
the mound building termite macrotermes michaelseni as an ecosystem engineer ||||| many organisms create or alter resource flows that affect the com position and spatial arrangement of current and future organismal diversity the phenomenon called ecosystem engineering is considered with a case study of the mound building termite macrotermes michaelseni it is argued that this species acts as an ecosystem engineer across a range of spatial scales from alteration of local infiltration rates to the creation of landscape mosaics and that its impacts accrue because of the initiation of biophysical processes that often include feedback mech anisms these changes to resource flows are likely to persist for long periods and constrain the biological structure of the habitat the value of ecosystem engineer ing is discussed as a holistic way of understanding the complexity of tropical ecology
biological activities of rice allelochemicals momilactone a and b ||||| momilactone a and b had been demonstrated to play critical roles in rice allelopathy by the findings of physiological and genetical approaches rice plants secrete momilactones into the rhizosphere over their entire life cycle at phytotoxic levels and momilactones are able to account for the majority of the observed rice allelopathy however allelopathic activities of momilactones were determined on only a few test plant species therefore this study was to determine the allelopathic activities of momilactones against nine test plant species including weed species and four rice cultivars momilactone a and b inhibited arabidopsis alfalfa lettuce cress timothy barnyard grass e colonum crabgrass and ryegrass at concentrations greater than and mm respectively the inhibition on those test plants was concentration dependent on the other hand effectiveness of momilactone a and b on rice cultivars koshihikari nipponbare norin and sasanishiki was very weak those rice cultivars were only inhibited by momilactone a and b at concentrations greater than and mm respectively momilactone a and b may have potential as templates for the development of new plant control substances because of their selective inhibitory activities on weed plant species more importantly momilactone a and b as allelochemicals in rice may provide a molecular marker for breeding and or engineering efforts directed at increasing allelopathic activity of this critical staple food crop

muscle moment arms of pelvic limb muscles of the ostrich struthio camelus ||||| muscle moment arms were measured for major muscles of the pelvic limb of the ostrich struthio camelus in order to assess specific functional behaviour and to apply this to locomotor performance pelvic limbs of six juvenile ostriches were used for this study the tendon travel technique was used to measure moment arms of muscles at the hip knee ankle and metatarsophalangeal joints throughout the ranges of motion observed during level running six of the muscles measured were found to have moment arms that did not change with joint angle whilst the remainder all demonstrated angle dependent changes for at least one of the joints crossed moment arm lengths tended to be longest for the large proximal muscles whilst the largest relative changes were found for the moment arms of the distal muscles for muscles where moment arm varied with joint angle all hip muscles were found to have increasing moment arms with extension of the joint knee flexors were found to have moment arms that increased with extension knee extensor moment arms were found to increase with flexion and ankle extensor moment arms increased with extension the greatest relative changes were observed in the flexors of the metatarsophalangeal joint for which a three fold increase in moment arm was observed from flexion to full extension changes in muscle moment arm through the range of motion studied appear to optimize muscle function during stance phase increasing the effective mechanical advantage of these muscles
how do plants notice attack by herbivorous arthropods ||||| precise and deep comprehension of plant responses to herbivorous arthropods requires detailed knowledge of how a plant notices the attack herbivore attack is not restricted to plant wounding by feeding but instead different phases of attack that elicit a plant response need to be distinguished touch oviposition and feeding touch secretions released with eggs and regurgitate delivered during feeding may act in concert as elicitors of plant defence here we discuss the current knowledge of what a plant notices during the different phases of herbivore attack and how it responds at the molecular physiological and ecological level understanding the mechanisms of plant responses to the different phases of herbivore attack will be a key challenge in unravelling the complex communication pathways between plants and herbivores
the role of biota in the initiation and growth of islands on the floodplain of the okavango alluvial fan botswana ||||| a group of islands of varying size on the floodplain of the okavango alluvial fan were studied to establish the processes which lead to the initiation and growth of islands it was found that islands are initiated by the mound building activities of the termite macrotermes michaelseni these termites import fine grained materials to use as a mortar for the construction of epigeal mounds their activities create a topographic feature raised above the level of seasonal flooding and also change the physical properties and nutrient status of the mound soil shrubs and trees are able to colonize these mounds which results in increased transpiration as a result precipitation of calcite and silica from the shallow ground water occurs preferentially beneath the mounds resulting in vertical and especially lateral growth causing island expansion c john wiley sons ltd
fatty acids identified in the burmese python promote beneficial cardiac growth ||||| a specific set of circulating fatty acids triggers cardiac hypertrophy in snakes and mammals burmese pythons display a marked increase in heart mass after a large meal we investigated the molecular mechanisms of this physiological heart growth with the goal of applying this knowledge to the mammalian heart we found that heart growth in pythons is characterized by myocyte hypertrophy in the absence of cell proliferation and by activation of physiological signal transduction pathways despite high levels of circulating lipids the postprandial python heart does not accumulate triglycerides or fatty acids instead there is robust activation of pathways of fatty acid transport and oxidation combined with increased expression and activity of superoxide dismutase a cardioprotective enzyme we also identified a combination of fatty acids in python plasma that promotes physiological heart growth when injected into either pythons or mice

exploiting social evolution in biofilms ||||| bacteria are highly social organisms that communicate via signaling molecules move collectively over surfaces and make biofilm communities nonetheless our main line of defense against pathogenic bacteria consists of antibiotics drugs that target individual level traits of bacterial cells and thus regrettably select for resistance against their own action a possible solution lies in targeting the mechanisms by which bacteria interact with each other within biofilms the emerging field of microbial social evolution combines molecular microbiology with evolutionary theory to dissect the molecular mechanisms and the evolutionary pressures underpinning bacterial sociality this exciting new research can ultimately lead to new therapies against biofilm infections that exploit evolutionary cheating or the trade off between biofilm formation and dispersal
evolution of the mechanisms underlying insect respiratory gas exchange ||||| abstract many factors influence gas exchange patterns in insects and are generally treated in isolation from one another here we provide a review of the current state of knowledge on the physics of gas exchange insect respiratory chemoreceptors the diversity and the methods typically used in the characterisation of respiratory pattern types briefly covering some of the new tools and techniques that are being incorporated into this field we then discuss the functional significance of insect gas exchange pattern variation and possible evolutionary explanations of discontinuous gas exchange as a derived control mechanism for effecting physiological change in the context of a adaptive hypotheses b non adaptive hypotheses and c mathematical modelling of gas exchange the lack of consensus in the literature for all proposed adaptive or mechanistic hypotheses suggests that multiple factors influence which gas exchange pattern is displayed by any particular insect during a given experiment thus while the primary function of a breathing pattern is to meet an animal s gas exchange requirements it is an interacting hierarchy of constraints that most likely determines how this demand may be met we conclude the review with a brief discussion of future directions for the field
structural design of the minute clypeasteroid echinoid echinocyamus pusillus ||||| the clypeasteroid echinoid skeleton is a multi plated light weight shell construction produced by biomineralization processes in shell constructions joints between individual elements are considered as weak points yet these echinoid skeletons show an extensive preservation potential in both recent and fossil environments the remarkable strength of the test is achieved by skeletal reinforcement structures and their constructional layouts micro computed tomography and scanning electron microscopy are used for microstructural and volumetric analyses of the echinoid s skeleton it is shown that strengthening mechanisms act on different hierarchical levels from the overall shape of the skeleton to skeletal interlocking the tight fitting and interlocking plate joints lead to a shell considered to behave as a monolithic structure the plate s architecture features distinct regions interpreted as a significant load transferring system the internal support system follows the segmentation of the remaining skeleton where sutural layout and stereom distribution are designed for effective load transfer the structural analysis of the multi plated yet monolithic skeleton of echinocyamus pusillus reveals new aspects of the micro morphology and its structural relevance for the load bearing behaviour the analysed structural principles allow e pusillus to be considered as a role model for the development of multi element light weight shell constructions

penguin heat retention structures evolved in a greenhouse earth ||||| penguins sphenisciformes inhabit some of the most extreme environments on earth the myr fossil record of penguins spans an interval that witnessed dramatic shifts in cenozoic ocean temperatures and currents indicating a long interplay between penguin evolution and environmental change perhaps the most celebrated example is the successful late cenozoic invasion of glacial environments by crown clade penguins a major adaptation that allows penguins to forage in cold water is the humeral arterial plexus a vascular counter current heat exchanger cche that limits heat loss through the flipper fossil evidence reveals that the humeral plexus arose at least ma during a greenhouse earth interval the evolution of the cche is therefore unrelated to global cooling or development of polar ice sheets but probably represents an adaptation to foraging in subsurface waters at temperate latitudes as global climate cooled the cche was key to invasion of thermally more demanding environments associated with antarctic ice sheets
kingfisher feathers colouration by pigments spongy nanostructures and thin films ||||| summary the colours of the common kingfisher alcedo atthis reside in the barbs of the three main types of feather the orange breast feathers the cyan back feathers and the blue tail feathers scanning electron microscopy showed that the orange barbs contain small pigment granules the cyan and blue barbs contain spongy nanostructures with slightly different dimensions causing different reflectance spectra imaging scatterometry showed that the pigmented barbs create a diffuse orange scattering and the spongy barb structures create iridescence the extent of the angle dependent light scattering increases with decreasing wavelength all barbs have a cortical envelope with a thickness of a few micrometres the reflectance spectra of the cortex of the barbs show oscillations when measured from small areas but when measured from larger areas the spectra become wavelength independent this can be directly understood with thin film modelling assuming a somewhat variable cortex thickness the cortex reflectance appears to be small but not negligible with respect to the pigmentary and structural barb reflectance
slippery surfaces of pitcher plants nepenthes wax crystals minimize insect attachment via microscopic surface roughness ||||| summary pitcher plants of the genus nepenthes efficiently trap and retain insect prey in highly specialized leaves besides a slippery peristome which inhibits adhesion of insects they employ epicuticular wax crystals on the inner walls of the conductive zone of the pitchers to hamper insect attachment by adhesive devices it has been proposed that the detachment of individual crystals and the resulting contamination of adhesive organs is responsible for capturing insects however our results provide evidence in favour of a different mechanism mainly based on the stability and the roughness of the waxy surface first we were unable to detect a large quantity of crystal fragments on the pads of insects detached from mature pitcher surfaces of nepenthes alata second investigation of the pitcher surface by focused ion beam treatment showed that the wax crystals form a compact d structure third atomic force microscopy of the platelet shaped crystals revealed that the crystals are mechanically stable rendering crystal detachment by insect pads unlikely fourth the surface profile parameters of the wax layer showed striking similarities to those of polishing paper with low grain size by measuring friction forces of insects on this artificial surface we demonstrate that microscopic roughness alone is sufficient to minimize insect attachment a theoretical model shows that surface roughness within a certain length scale will prevent adhesion by being too rough for adhesive pads but not rough enough for claws

human defensins turning defense into offense ||||| defensins are a family of antimicrobial cationic peptides that act as a rapid response force against microbial invasion in a wide range of organisms including plants insects animals and humans in humans defensins are produced predominantly by leukocytes and epithelial cells and are an important factor of innate immunity in addition to their major role as natural antibiotics defensins are increasingly recognized as signaling molecules in adaptive immunity and aberrant defensin expression has been associated with infectious diseases in this review we discuss the role of human defensins in relation to infectious disease and the possibility of novel defensin based therapeutic approaches
in vitro study of magnesium calcite biomineralization in the skeletal materials of the seastar pisaster giganteus ||||| the mechanisms of formation of biogenic magnesium rich calcite remain an enigma here we present ultrastructural and compositional details of ossicles from the seastar pisaster giganteus echinodermata asteroidea powder x ray diffraction infrared spectroscopy and elemental analyses confirm that the ossicles are composed of magnesium rich calcite whilst also containing about w w of soluble organic matrix som as an intracrystalline component amino acid analysis and n terminal sequencing revealed that this mixture of intracrystalline macromolecules consists predominantly of glycine rich polypeptides in vitro calcium carbonate precipitation experiments indicate that the som accelerates the conversion of amorphous calcium carbonate acc into its final crystalline product from this observation and from the discovery of acc in other closely related taxa it is suggested that substitution of magnesium into the calcite lattice through a transient precursor phase may be a universal phenomenon prevalent across the phylum echinodermata
energy transfer and trapping in photosystem i ||||| the primary processes in all photosynthetic systems involve the absorption of energy from sun light by chromophores in a light harvesting antenna and the subsequent transfer of this energy to a reaction centre rc site where the energy is trapped by means of a stable charge separation photosystem ps i is one of two such photosystems in oxygenic photosynthesis when co operating with ps ii it uses the energy of light to transfer electrons from plastocyanin or soluble cytochrome c to ferredoxin and eventually to nadp in an alternative pathway the electrons from ferredoxin are transferred back to plastocyanin via the cytochrome b f complex this cyclic electron transport which does not require the input of free energy by ps ii results in a transmembrane electrochemical gradient that can be used to produce atp in plants and green algae the ps i complex consists of two separable functional units the ps i core and the light harvesting complex lhc i peripheral antenna the ps i complex in cyanobacteria does not possess the peripheral lhci antenna but since the ps i core complexes of cyanobacteria bear a large resemblance to the core complex of plants a direct comparison of the energy transfer and trapping properties of these complexes is justic ed
locomotion of gymnarchus niloticus experiment and kinematics ||||| in addition to forward undulatory swimming gymnarchus niloticus can swim via undulations of the dorsal fin while the body axis remains straight furthermore it swims forward and backward in a similar way which indicates that the undulation of the dorsal fin can simultaneously provide bidirectional propulsive and maneuvering forces with the help of the tail fin a high resolution charge coupled device ccd imaging camera system is used to record kinematics of steady swimming as well as maneuvering in g niloticus based on experimental data this paper discusses the kinematics cruising speed wave speed cycle frequency amplitude lateral displacement of forward as well as backward swimming and maneuvering during forward swimming the propulsive force is generated mainly by undulations of the dorsal fin while the body axis remains straight the kinematic parameters wave speed wavelength cycle frequency amplitude have statistically significant correlations with cruising speed in addition the yaw at the head is minimal during steady swimming from experimental data the maximal lateral displacement of head is not more than of the body length while the maximal lateral displacement of the whole body is not more than of the body length another important feature is that g niloticus swims backwards using an undulatory mechanism that resembles the forward undulatory swimming mechanism in backward swimming the increase of lateral displacement of the head is comparatively significant the amplitude profiles of the propulsive wave along the dorsal fin are significantly different from those in forward swimming when g niloticus does fast maneuvering its body is first bent into either a c shape or an s shape then it is rapidly unwound in a travelling wave fashion it rarely maneuvers without the help of the tail fin and body bending
the effect of molluscan glue proteins on gel mechanics ||||| summary several molluscs have been shown to alternate between a non adhesive trail mucus and a similar gel that forms a strong glue the major structural difference between the two secretions is the presence of specific proteins in the adhesive mucus the present study identifies similar proteins from the glue of the slug arion subfuscus and the land snail helix aspersa to investigate the role played by these proteins in adhesion the proteins were isolated from the adhesive mucus of different molluscs and added to commercial polymer solutions the effect was observed qualitatively and quantified using a dynamic rheometer the isolated proteins triggered gelling or visible stiffening of agar pectin and polygalacturonic acid the effect was stronger on more negatively charged polymers the effect of the proteins was concentration dependent with an optimal concentration of mg ml and was weakened when their structure changed other proteins and carbohydrates found in the adhesive mucus had no clear mechanical effect on gels these findings show that the addition of these proteins to large anionic polymers plays a central role in the formation of a glue from a mucus like secretion such a mechanism may be common among invertebrates and it may guide biomimetic approaches in the development of glues and gels
effects of sea hare ink secretion and its escapin generated components on a variety of predatory fishes ||||| sea hares aplysia californica have a diversity of anti predatory defenses one is an actively released chemical defense an ink secretion that is a mixture of two glandular products ink from the ink gland and opaline from the opaline gland the mechanisms of action of ink secretion and its components have recently been examined in detail against several predatory invertebrates our goal is to extend this mechanistic analysis to predatory vertebrates toward this end the current study details the effects of ink opaline and one set of its components the products of the reaction of escapin an l amino acid oxidase with its natural substrates l lysine and l arginine on the palatability of food for five species of fishes bluehead wrasses thalassoma bifasciatum senorita wrasses oxyjulis californica pinfish lagodon rhomboides mummichogs fundulus heteroclitus and bonnethead sharks sphyrna tiburo these fishes have different feeding styles ranging from large fishes able to engulf sea hares to smaller fishes able to attack sea hares by pecking at them and they live in a variety of habitats including those that sea hares typically inhabit we show that ink but not opaline significantly decreases the palatability of food for all five species and that escapin products are mildly unpalatable to the two species of wrasses but not to the other species these results together with others show that sea hare ink affects a diversity of predatory fishes setting the stage for mechanistic studies using electrophysiological analysis of their chemosensory systems
pigment chemistry the red sweat of the hippopotamus ||||| within a few minutes of perspiration the colourless viscous sweat of the hippopotamus gradually turns red and then brown as the pigment polymerizes here we isolate and characterize the pigments responsible for this colour reaction the unstable red and orange pigments turn out to be non benzenoid aromatic compounds that are unexpectedly acidic and have antibiotic as well as sunscreen activity
arsenic hyperaccumulator fern pteris vittata utilities for arsenic phytoremediation and plant biotechnology ||||| arsenic is a toxic metalloid that is widespread in the environment due to both man made and natural causes soils food and ground water contaminated with arsenic pose serious health risks to millions of people in different parts of the world while engineering methods to remediate arsenic contaminated environments are available they are often prohibitively expensive and cumbersome it was discovered about a decade ago that the chinese brake fern pteris vittata had an extraordinary ability to tolerate and hyperaccumulate arsenic up to about of dry weight in its fronds this opened up new opportunities to develop the brake fern for a cost effective green technology to remediate arsenic contaminated environments the objective of this review is to highlight some of the salient findings on this and related ferns regarding their arsenic tolerance and hyperaccumulation traits investigations have shown that arsenic hyperaccumulation in brake fern has evolved as a defense against herbivory research employing molecular biology tools have identified some of the key genes and proteins important for arsenic metabolism in this species including genes for arsenic induced oxidative stress comparative biochemistry of how organisms adapt to arsenic suggests that many other fern genes related to arsenic transport and metabolism are yet to be characterized in this fern our research indicates that brake fern could be a source of genes that could inform us about how plants adapt to abiotic stress factors such as high temperature stress and drought that have oxidative stress as a component some of these genes can be expected to be valuable for improving crops for increased tolerance to stress
photoprotection of green plants a mechanism of ultra fast thermal energy dissipation in desiccated lichens ||||| in order to survive sunlight in the absence of water desiccation tolerant green plants need to be protected against photooxidation during drying of the chlorolichen cladonia rangiformis and the cyanolichen peltigera neckeri chlorophyll fluorescence decreased and stable light dependent charge separation in reaction centers of the photosynthetic apparatus was lost the presence of light during desiccation increased loss of fluorescence in the chlorolichen more than that in the cyanolichen heating of desiccated cladonia thalli but not of peltigera thalli increased fluorescence emission more after the lichen had been dried in the light than after drying in darkness activation of zeaxanthin dependent energy dissipation by protonation of the psbs protein of thylakoid membranes was not responsible for the increased loss of chlorophyll fluorescence by the chlorolichen during drying in the light glutaraldehyde inhibited loss of chlorophyll fluorescence during drying desiccation induced loss of chlorophyll fluorescence and of light dependent charge separation are interpreted to indicate activation of a highly effective mechanism of photoprotection in the lichens activation is based on desiccation induced conformational changes of a pigment protein complex absorbed light energy is converted into heat within a picosecond or femtosecond time domain when present during desiccation light interacts with the structural changes of the protein providing increased photoprotection energy dissipation is inactivated and structural changes are reversed when water becomes available again reversibility of ultra fast thermal dissipation of light energy avoids photo damage in the absence of water and facilitates the use of light for photosynthesis almost as soon as water becomes available
the transition from stiff to compliant materials in squid beaks ||||| the beak of the humboldt squid dosidicus gigas represents one of the hardest and stiffest wholly organic materials known as it is deeply embedded within the soft buccal envelope the manner in which impact forces are transmitted between beak and envelope is a matter of considerable scientific interest here we show that the hydrated beak exhibits a large stiffness gradient spanning two orders of magnitude from the tip to the base this gradient is correlated with a chemical gradient involving mixtures of chitin water and his rich proteins that contain dihydroxyphenyl l alanine dopa and undergo extensive stabilization by histidyl dopa cross link formation these findings may serve as a foundation for identifying design principles for attaching mechanically mismatched materials in engineering and biological applications
propulsive force calculations in swimming frogs i a momentum impulse approach ||||| summary frogs are animals that are capable of locomotion in two physically different media aquatic and terrestrial a comparison of the kinematics of swimming frogs in a previous study revealed a difference in propulsive impulse between jumping and swimming to explore this difference further we determined the instantaneous forces during propulsion in swimming using an impulse momentum approach based on dpiv flow data the force profile obtained was compared with force profiles obtained from drag thrust equilibrium of the centre of mass and with the force profiles generated during jumping the new approach to quantifying the instantaneous forces during swimming was tested and proved to be a valid method for determining the external forces on the feet of swimming frogs on the kinematic profiles of swimming leg extension precedes propulsion this means that it is not only the acceleration of water backwards that provides thrust but also that the deceleration of water flowing towards the frog as a result of recovery accelerates the centre of mass prior to leg extension the force profile obtained from the impulse momentum approach exposed an overestimation of drag by in the drag thrust calculations this means that the difference in impulse between jumping and swimming in frogs is even larger than previously stated the difference between the force profiles apart from a slightly higher peak force during jumping lies mainly in a difference in shape during swimming maximal force is reached early in the extension phase into it while during jumping peak force is attained at of the extension phase this difference is caused by a difference in inter limb coordination

k water searches scent and scent transport considerations ||||| abstract increased use of water search dogs for detecting submerged bodies has created the need for a better understanding of scent emanating from the bodies and how it transits the water to the dog s nose a review of recent literature identifies likely scent sources potential scent transport processes and research needs scent sources include gases in bubbles or dissolved in the water liquids as buoyant plumes and droplets or dissolved in the water and solids consisting of buoyant particulates with secretions bacteria and body fluids potential transport processes through the water include buoyancy entrainment and turbulence transport processes from the water surface into the air include volatilization and evaporation enhanced by bubble bursting breaking waves splashing and wind spray implications for the use of water search dogs are examined observations of submerged decomposing bodies are needed to quantify the physical and chemical characteristics of the scent and scent transport processes
colourful parrot feathers resist bacterial degradation ||||| the brilliant red orange and yellow colours of parrot feathers are the product of psittacofulvins which are synthetic pigments known only from parrots recent evidence suggests that some pigments in bird feathers function not just as colour generators but also preserve plumage integrity by increasing the resistance of feather keratin to bacterial degradation we exposed a variety of colourful parrot feathers to feather degrading bacillus licheniformis and found that feathers with red psittacofulvins degraded at about the same rate as those with melanin and more slowly than white feathers which lack pigments blue feathers in which colour is based on the microstructural arrangement of keratin air and melanin granules and green feathers which combine structural blue with yellow psittacofulvins degraded at a rate similar to that of red and black feathers these differences in resistance to bacterial degradation of differently coloured feathers suggest that colour patterns within the psittaciformes may have evolved to resist bacterial degradation in addition to their role in communication and camouflage
a nocturnal mammal the greater mouse eared bat calibrates a magnetic compass by the sun ||||| recent evidence suggests that bats can detect the geomagnetic field but the way in which this is used by them for navigation to a home roost remains unresolved the geomagnetic field may be used by animals both to indicate direction and to locate position in birds directional information appears to be derived from an interaction of the magnetic field with either the sun or the stars with some evidence suggesting that sunset sunrise provides the primary directional reference by which a magnetic compass is calibrated daily we demonstrate that homing greater mouse eared bats myotis myotis calibrate a magnetic compass with sunset cues by testing their homing response after exposure to an altered magnetic field at and after sunset magnetic manipulation at sunset resulted in a counterclockwise shift in orientation compared with controls consistent with sunset calibration of the magnetic field whereas magnetic manipulation after sunset resulted in no change in orientation unlike in birds however the pattern of polarization was not necessary for the calibration for animals that occupy ecological niches where the sunset is rarely observed this is a surprising finding yet it may indicate the primacy of the sun as an absolute geographical reference not only for birds but also within other vertebrate taxa
feeding mechanisms of adult lepidoptera structure function and evolution of the mouthparts ||||| the form and function of the mouthparts in adult lepidoptera and their feeding behavior are reviewed from evolutionary and ecological points of view the formation of the suctorial proboscis encompasses a fluid tight food tube special linking structures modified sensory equipment and novel intrinsic musculature the evolution of these functionally important traits can be reconstructed within the lepidoptera the proboscis movements are explained by a hydraulic mechanism for uncoiling whereas recoiling is governed by the intrinsic proboscis musculature and the cuticular elasticity fluid uptake is accomplished by the action of the cranial sucking pump which enables uptake of a wide range of fluid quantities from different food sources nectar feeding species exhibit stereotypical proboscis movements during flower handling behavioral modifications and derived proboscis morphology are often associated with specialized feeding preferences or an obligatory switch to alternative food sources
frequency specificity of vibration dependent discharge of nematocysts in sea anemones ||||| hair bundles on tentacles of sea anemones are similar to vertebrate hair bundles in terms of structure and function anemone hair bundles are involved in regulating discharge of nematocysts stinging capsules used to capture prey n acetylated sugars from the prey including n acetylneuraminic acid nana induce hair bundles to elongate while shifting vibration dependent discharge of nematocysts to lower frequencies matching prey movements in the present study we find that vibration dependent discharge of nematocysts exhibits sharp frequency discrimination to within one hz testing at one hz intervals over the range of frequencies spanning hz we find that seven of these are stimulatory in seawater alone a total of twenty six frequencies are stimulatory in the presence of nana stimulatory frequencies in nana are lower than those in seawater alone we find that antagonists of ryanodine receptors including ryanodine procaine and tetracaine shift discharge to lower frequencies fluorescently tagged ryanodine labels numerous small loci in the apical cytoplasm of supporting cells we propose that calcium induced calcium release cicr via ryanodine receptors may sharpen frequency specificity and or cause shortening of hair bundles to shift frequency specificity to higher frequencies
sacrificial bonds and hidden length unraveling molecular mesostructures in tough materials ||||| sacrificial bonds and hidden length in structural molecules and composites have been found to greatly increase the fracture toughness of biomaterials by providing a reversible molecular scale energy dissipation mechanism this mechanism relies on the energy of order ev needed to reduce entropy and increase enthalpy as molecular segments are stretched after being released by the breaking of weak bonds called sacrificial bonds this energy is relatively large compared to the energy needed to break the polymer backbone of order a few ev in many biological cases the breaking of sacrificial bonds has been found to be reversible thereby additionally providing a self healing property to the material due to the nanoscopic nature of this mechanism single molecule force spectroscopy using an atomic force microscope has been a useful tool to investigate this mechanism especially when investigating natural molecular constructs force versus distance curves quickly become very complicated in this work we propose various types of sacrificial bonds their combination and how they appear in single molecule force spectroscopy measurements we find that by close analysis of the force spectroscopy curves additional information can be obtained about the molecules and their bonds to the native constructs
the structure of the water holding feathers of the namaqua sandgrouse ||||| the morphology and fine structure of the feather barbules of the namaqua sandgrouse pterocles namaqua are investigated histologically and experimentally by means of light microscopy scanning electron micrography and x ray diffraction proximally the barbule is helically coiled for three and a half turns and has a kidney shaped concave convex transverse section the inner concave surface is pitted the outer convex surface smooth the barbule is solid consisting of three layers and bears a number of appendages at its distal end where it is more rounded in transverse section the uncoiling of barbules from the abdominal feathers on contact with water may be initiated by water uptake and further facilitated by the number of helical coils at the base of the barbules the keratin is fairly crystalline when dry this crystallinity is somewhat reduced on wetting the uncoiling mechanism is related to the expansion of the polypeptide chains of il keratin in order to accommodate additional water bound to the side chains
regulation of brain temperature in winter acclimatized reindeer under heat stress ||||| summary reindeer rangifer tarandus are protected against the arctic winter cold by thick fur of prime insulating capacity and hence have few avenues of heat loss during work we have investigated how these animals regulate brain temperature under heavy heat loads animals were instrumented for measurements of blood flow tissue temperatures and respiratory frequency f under full anaesthesia whereas measurements were also made in fully conscious animals while in a climatic chamber or running on a treadmill at rest brain temperature tbrain rose from degc at degc to degc at degc while f increased from x to x breaths min with a change to open mouth panting omp at tbrain degc and carotid and sublingual arterial flows increased by and respectively omp caused jugular venous and carotid arterial temperatures to drop presumably owing to a much increased respiratory evaporative heat loss angular oculi vein aov flow was negligible until tbrain reached degc but it increased to ml min kg at tbrain degc bilateral occlusion of both aovs induced omp and a rise in tbrain and f at tbrain degc we propose that reindeer regulate body and particularly brain temperature under heavy heat loads by a combination of panting at first through the nose but later when the heat load and the minute volume requirements increase due to exercise primarily through the mouth and that they eventually resort to selective brain cooling
snake velvet black hierarchical micro and nanostructure enhances dark colouration in bitis rhinoceros ||||| the west african gaboon viper bitis rhinoceros is a master of camouflage due to its colouration pattern its skin is geometrically patterned and features black spots that purport an exceptional spatial depth due to their velvety surface texture our study shades light on micromorphology optical characteristics and principles behind such a velvet black appearance we revealed a unique hierarchical pattern of leaf like microstructures striated with nanoridges on the snake scales that coincides with the distribution of black colouration velvet black sites demonstrate four times lower reflectance and higher absorbance than other scales in the uv near ir spectral range the combination of surface structures impeding reflectance and absorbing dark pigments deposited in the skin material provides reflecting less than of the light reflected by a polytetrafluoroethylene diffuse reflectance standard in any direction a view angle independent black structural colour in snakes is reported here for the first time
to bend a coralline effect of joint morphology on flexibility and stress amplification in an articulated calcified seaweed ||||| summary previous studies have demonstrated that fleshy seaweeds resist wave induced drag forces in part by being flexible flexibility allows fronds to go with the flow reconfiguring into streamlined shapes and reducing frond area projected into flow this paradigm extends even to articulated coralline algae which produce calcified fronds that are flexible only because they have distinct joints genicula the evolution of flexibility through genicula was a major event that allowed articulated coralline algae to grow elaborate erect fronds in wave exposed habitats here we describe the mechanics of genicula in the articulated coralline calliarthron and demonstrate how segmentation affects bending performance and amplifies bending stresses within genicula a numerical model successfully predicted deflections of articulated fronds by assuming genicula to be assemblages of cables connecting adjacent calcified segments intergenicula by varying the dimensions of genicula in the model we predicted the optimal genicular morphology that maximizes flexibility while minimizing stress amplification morphological dimensions of genicula most prone to bending stresses i e genicula near the base of fronds match model predictions
explosive flowering nectar production breeding systems and pollinators of new zealand mistletoes loranthaceae ||||| the six new zealand loranthaceous mis tletoes fall into two groups based on pollination bi ology four alepis flavida peraxilla colensoi p tetrapetala and trilepidea adamsii are bird polli nated with hermaphrodite flowers while the other two ileostylus micranthus and tupeia antarctica are dioecious or sub dioecious and insect pollinated we provide data on the pollination biology of the five extant species trilepidea is extinct the two peraxilla species and trilepidea have recently been shown to have explosive flowers here we show that alepis has weakly facultatively explo sive flowers the world distribution of explosive mistletoe flowers suggests that the syndrome has arisen a number of times independently within the family and is found in about half the putatively ancestral genera the principal avian visitors to the bird pollinated species were tui and bellbirds introduced species are numerically unimportant as pollinators the nectar production schedules of alepis and peraxilla encour age single visit pollination as little nectar is produced after the flowers open however when bird densi ties are high buds of peraxilla may be forced open prematurely encouraging multiple visits

magnetoreception system in honeybees apis mellifera ||||| honeybees apis mellifera undergo iron biomineralization providing the basis for magnetoreception we showed earlier the presence of superparamagnetic magnetite in iron granules formed in honeybees and subscribed to the notion that external magnetic fields may cause expansion or contraction of the superparamagnetic particles in an orientation specific manner relaying the signal via cytoskeleton hsu and li in this study we established a size density purification procedure with which quantitative amount of iron granules was obtained from honey bee trophocytes and characterized the density of iron granules was determined to be g cm while we confirmed the presence of superparamagnetic magnetite in the iron granules we observed changes in the size of the magnetic granules in the trophycytes upon applying additional magnetic field to the cells a concomitant release of calcium ion was observed by confocal microscope this size fluctuation triggered the increase of intracellular ca which was inhibited by colchicines and latrunculin b known to be blockers for microtubule and microfilament syntheses respectively the associated cytoskeleton may thus relay the magnetosignal initiating a neural response a model for the mechanism of magnetoreception in honeybees is proposed which may be applicable to most if not all magnetotactic organisms
ecology and biology of the pacific walrus odobenus rosmarus divergens illiger ||||| abstractthe distribution physical development pelage dentition feeding behavior reproduction causes of mortality and population structure of the pacific walrus odobenus rosmarus divergens were studied intermittently from to in winter these animals tend to concentrate in north central and southeastern bering sea where sea ice conditions are most favorable for them in summer they concentrate mainly in northwestern and northeastern chukchi sea along the edge of the ice most of the northward migrants are females and young a large proportion of the adult males remains in the bering sea throughout the summer pacific walruses show strong sexual dimorphism adult males are about longer and heavier and tend to have larger more divergent tusks as well as thicker lighter colored and less hairy skin than adult females as in other sexually dimorphic otarioid pinnipeds males undergo secondary growth beginning about the time of puberty and ending in full physical maturity about
surface tension propulsion of fungal spores ||||| summary most basidiomycete fungi actively eject their spores the process begins with the condensation of a water droplet at the base of the spore the fusion of the droplet onto the spore creates a momentum that propels the spore forward the use of surface tension for spore ejection offers a new paradigm to perform work at small length scales however this mechanism of force generation remains poorly understood to elucidate how fungal spores make effective use of surface tension we performed a detailed mechanical analysis of the three stages of spore ejection the transfer of energy from the drop to the spore the work of fracture required to release the spore from its supporting structure and the kinetic energy of the spore after ejection high speed video imaging of spore ejection in auricularia auricula and sporobolomyces yeasts revealed that drop coalescence takes place over a short distance mm and energy transfer is completed in less than ms based on these observations we developed an explicit relation for the conversion of surface energy into kinetic energy during the coalescence process the relation was validated with a simple artificial system and shown to predict the initial spore velocity accurately predicted velocity m s observed velocity m s for a auricula using calibrated microcantilevers we also demonstrate that the work required to detach the spore from the supporting sterigma represents only a small fraction of the total energy available for spore ejection finally our observations of this unique discharge mechanism reveal a surprising similarity with the mechanics of jumping in animals
electrical signals control wound healing through phosphatidylinositol oh kinase g and pten ||||| wound healing is essential for maintaining the integrity of multicellular organisms in every species studied disruption of an epithelial layer instantaneously generates endogenous electric fields which have been proposed to be important in wound healing the identity of signalling pathways that guide both cell migration to electric cues and electric field induced wound healing have not been elucidated at a genetic level here we show that electric fields of a strength equal to those detected endogenously direct cell migration during wound healing as a prime directional cue manipulation of endogenous wound electric fields affects wound healing in vivo electric stimulation triggers activation of src and inositol phospholipid signalling which polarizes in the direction of cell migration notably genetic disruption of phosphatidylinositol oh kinase g pi kg decreases electric field induced signalling and abolishes directed movements of healing epithelium in response to electric signals deletion of the tumour suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog pten enhances signalling and electrotactic responses these data identify genes essential for electrical signal induced wound healing and show that pi kg and pten control electrotaxis
localized fluidization burrowing mechanics of ensis directus ||||| summary muscle measurements of ensis directus the atlantic razor clam indicate that the organism only has sufficient strength to burrow a few centimeters into the soil yet razor clams burrow to over cm in this paper we show that the animal uses the motions of its valves to locally fluidize the surrounding soil and reduce burrowing drag substrate deformations were measured using particle image velocimetry piv in a novel visualization system that enabled us to see through the soil and watch e directus burrow in situ piv data supported by soil and fluid mechanics theory show that contraction of the valves of e directus locally fluidizes the surrounding soil particle and fluid mixtures can be modeled as a newtonian fluid with an effective viscosity based on the local void fraction using these models we demonstrate that e directus is strong enough to reach full burrow depth in fluidized soil but not in static soil furthermore we show that the method of localized fluidization reduces the amount of energy required to reach burrow depth by an order of magnitude compared with penetrating static soil and leads to a burrowing energy that scales linearly with depth rather than with depth squared
the protective role of aquaporins in the freeze tolerant insect eurosta solidaginis functional characterization and tissue abundance of esaqp ||||| summary the movement of water and small solutes is integral to the survival of freezing and desiccation in insects yet the underlying mechanisms of these processes are not fully known recent evidence suggests that aquaporin aqp water channels play critical roles in protecting cells from osmotic damage during freezing and desiccation our study sequenced functionally characterized and measured the tissue abundance of an aqp from freeze tolerant larvae of the gall fly eurosta solidaginis diptera tephritidae the newly characterized esaqp contains two npa motifs and six transmembrane regions and is phylogenetically related to an aqp from the anhydrobiotic chironomid polypedilum vanderplanki using a xenopus laevis oocyte swelling assay we demonstrated that esaqp increases water permeability to nine times that of simple diffusion through the membrane in contrast to its high water permeability esaqp was impermeable to both glycerol and urea the abundance of esaqp increased from october to december in all tissues tested and was most abundant in the brain of winter larvae because the nervous system is thought to be the primary site of freezing injury esaqp may cryoprotect the brain from damage associated with water imbalance the sequence phylogenetic relationship osmotic permeability tissue distribution and seasonal abundance of esaqp further support the role of aqps in promoting freezing tolerance
optical solar energy adaptations and radiative temperature control of green leaves and tree barks ||||| trees have adapted to keep leaves and barks cool in sunshine and can serve as interesting bionic model systems for radiative cooling silicon solar cells on the other hand loose up to one third of their energy efficiency due to heating in intensive sunshine it is shown that green leaves minimize absorption of useful radiation and allow efficient infrared thermal emission since elevated temperatures are detrimental for tensile water flow in the xylem tissue below barks the optical properties of barks should also have evolved so as to avoid excessive heating this was tested by performing optical studies with tree bark samples from representative trees it was found that tree barks have optimized their reflection of incoming sunlight between and mm this is approximately the optical window in which solar light is transmitted and reflected by green vegetation simultaneously the tree bark is highly absorbing and thus radiation emitting between and mm these two properties mainly provided by tannins create optimal conditions for radiative temperature control in addition tannins seem to have adopted a function as mediators for excitation energy towards photo antioxidative activity for control of radiation damage the results obtained are used to discuss challenges for future solar cell optimization
molecular nanomechanics of nascent bone fibrillar toughening by mineralization ||||| mineralized collagen fibrils are highly conserved nanostructural building blocks of bone by a combination of molecular dynamics simulation and theoretical analysis it is shown that the characteristic nanostructure of mineralized collagen fibrils is vital for its high strength and its ability to sustain large deformation as is relevant to the physiological role of bone creating a strong and tough material an analysis of the molecular mechanisms of protein and mineral phases under large deformation of mineralized collagen fibrils reveals a fibrillar toughening mechanism that leads to a manifold increase of energy dissipation compared to fibrils without mineral phase this fibrillar toughening mechanism increases the resistance to fracture by forming large local yield regions around crack like defects a mechanism that protects the integrity of the entire structure by allowing for localized failure as a consequence mineralized collagen fibrils are able to tolerate microcracks of the order of several hundred micrometres in size without causing any macroscopic failure of the tissue which may be essential to enable bone remodelling the analysis proves that adding nanoscopic small platelets to collagen fibrils increases their young s modulus and yield strength as well as their fracture strength we find that mineralized collagen fibrils have a young s modulus of gpa versus gpa for the collagen fibril yield at a tensile strain of versus for the collagen fibril and feature a fracture stress of gpa versus gpa for the collagen fibril
salt tolerance mechanisms in mangroves a review ||||| mangroves are woody plants which form the dominant vegetation in tidal saline wetlands along tropical and subtropical coasts the current knowledge concerning the most striking feature of mangroves i e their unique ability to tolerate high salinity is summarized in the present review in this review we shall discuss recent studies that have focused on morphological anatomical physiological biochemical molecular and genetic attributes associated with the response to salinity some of which presumably function to mediate salt tolerance in the mangroves here we shall also review the major advances recently made at both the genetic and the genomic levels in mangroves salinity tolerance in mangroves depends on a range of adaptations including ion compartmentation osmoregulation selective transport and uptake of ions maintenance of a balance between the supply of ions to the shoot and capacity to accommodate the salt influx the tolerance of mangroves to a high saline environment is also tightly linked to the regulation of gene expression by integrating the information from mangroves and performing comparisons among species of mangroves and non mangroves we could give a general picture of salt tolerance mechanisms of mangroves thus providing a new avenue for development of salt tolerance in crop plants through effective breeding strategies and genetic engineering techniques
hydrophobic trichome layers and epicuticular wax powders in bromeliaceae ||||| the distinctive foliar trichome of bromeliaceae has promoted the evolution of an epiphytic habit in certain taxa by allowing the shoot to assume a significant role in the uptake of water and mineral nutrients despite the profound ecophysiological and taxonomic importance of this epidermal structure the functions of nonabsorbent trichomes in remaining bromeliaceae are not fully understood the hypothesis that light reflection from these trichome layers provides photoprotection was not supported by spectroradiometry and fluorimetry in the present study the mean reflectance of visible light from trichome layers did not exceed on the adaxial surfaces of species representing a range of ecophysiological types nor was significant photoprotection provided by their presence several reports suggesting water repellency in some terrestrial bromeliaceae were investigated scanning electron microscopy sem and a new technique fluorographic dimensional imaging fdi were used to assess the interaction between aqueous droplets and the leaf surfaces of species from genera in the majority of cases a dense layer of overlapping stellate or peltate trichomes held water off the leaf epidermis proper in the case of hydrophobic tank forming tillandsioideae a powdery epicuticular wax layer provided water repellency the irregular architecture of these indumenta resulted in relatively little contact with water droplets most mesic terrestrial pitcairnioideae examined either possessed glabrous leaf blades or hydrophobic layers of confluent trichomes on the abaxial surface thus the present study indicates that an important ancestral function of the foliar trichome in bromeliaceae was water repellency the ecophysiological consequences of hydrophobia are discussed
geographical variation in bill size across bird species provides evidence for allen s rule ||||| allen s rule proposes that the appendages of endotherms are smaller relative to body size in colder climates in order to reduce heat loss empirical support for allen s rule is mainly derived from occasional reports of geographical clines in extremity size of individual species interspecific evidence is restricted to two studies of leg proportions in seabirds and shorebirds we used phylogenetic comparative analyses of bird species to examine whether bird bills significant sites of heat exchange conform to allen s rule the species comprised eight diverse taxonomic groups toucans african barbets australian parrots estrildid finches canadian galliforms penguins gulls and terns across all species there were strongly significant relationships between bill length and both latitude and environmental temperature with species in colder climates having significantly shorter bills patterns supporting allen s rule in relation to latitudinal or altitudinal distribution held within all groups except the finches evidence for a direct association with temperature was found within four groups parrots galliforms penguins and gulls support for allen s rule in leg elements was weaker suggesting that bird bills may be more susceptible to thermoregulatory constraints generally our results provide the strongest comparative support yet published for allen s rule and demonstrate that thermoregulation has been an important factor in shaping the evolution of bird bills
avoidance of catastrophic structural failure as an evolutionary constraint biomechanics of the acorn weevil rostrum ||||| the acorn weevil curculio linnaeus rostrum snout exhibits remarkable flexibility and toughness derived from the microarchitecture of its exoskeleton modifications to the composite profile of the rostral cuticle that simultaneously enhance the flexibility and toughness of the distal portion of the snout are characterized using classical laminate plate theory the effect of these modifications on the elastic behavior of the exoskeleton is estimated it is shown that the tensile behavior of the rostrum across six curculio species with high morphological variation correlates with changes in the relative layer thicknesses and orientation angles of layers in the exoskeleton accordingly increased endocuticle thickness is strongly correlated with increased tensile strength rostrum stiffness is shown to be inversely correlated with work of fracture thus allowing a highly curved rostrum to completely straighten without structural damage finally exocuticle rich invaginations of the occipital sutures are identified both as a likely site of crack initiation in tensile failure and as a source of morphological constraint on the evolution of the rostrum in curculio weevils it is concluded that avoidance of catastrophic structural failure as initiated in these sutures under tension is the driving selective pressure in the evolution of the female curculio rostrum
natural light harvesting principles and environmental trends ||||| light harvesting in photosynthetic organisms is largely an efficient process the first steps of the light phase of photosynthesis capture of light quanta and primary charge separation processes are particularly well tuned in plants these primary events that take place within the photosystems possess remarkable quantum efficiency reaching and in photosystems ii and i respectively this paper presents a view on the organisation of a natural light harvesting machine the antenna of the photosystem ii of higher plants it explains the key principles of biological antenna design and the strategies of adaptation to light environment which have evolved over millions of years this article argues that the high efficiency of the light harvesting antenna and its control are intimately interconnected owing to the molecular design of the pigment proteins it is built of enabling high pigment density combined with the long excited state lifetime the protein plays the role of a programmed solvent accommodating high quantities of pigments while ensuring their orientations and interaction yields are optimised to efficiently transfer energy to the reaction centres simultaneously avoiding energy losses due to concentration quenching the minor group of pigments the xanthophylls play a central role in the regulation of light harvesting defining the antenna efficiency and thus its abilities to simultaneously provide energy to photosystem ii and protect itself from excess light damage xanthophyll hydrophobicity was found to be a key factor controlling chlorophyll efficiency by modulating pigment pigment and pigment protein interactions xanthophylls also endow the light harvesting antenna with the remarkable ability to memorise photosystem ii light exposure a light counter principle indeed this type of light harvesting regulation displays hysteretic behaviour typically observed during electromagnetic induction of ferromagnetic materials the polarization of ferroelectric materials and the deformation of semi elastic materials the photosynthetic antenna is thus a magnificent example of how nature utilises the principles of physics to achieve its goal extremely efficient robust autonomic and yet flexible light harvesting
auditory spatial acuity approximates the resolving power of space specific neurons ||||| the relationship between neuronal acuity and behavioral performance was assessed in the barn owl tyto alba a nocturnal raptor renowned for its ability to localize sounds and for the topographic representation of auditory space found in the midbrain we measured discrimination of sound source separation using a newly developed procedure involving the habituation and recovery of the pupillary dilation response the smallest discriminable change of source location was found to be about two times finer in azimuth than in elevation recordings from neurons in its midbrain space map revealed that their spatial tuning like the spatial discrimination behavior was also better in azimuth than in elevation by a factor of about two because the pdr behavioral assay is mediated by the same circuitry whether discrimination is assessed in azimuth or in elevation this difference in vertical and horizontal acuity is likely to reflect a true difference in sensory resolution without additional confounding effects of differences in motor performance in the two dimensions our results therefore are consistent with the hypothesis that the acuity of the midbrain space map determines auditory spatial discrimination
nests petal usage floral preferences and immatures of osmia ozbekosmia avosetta megachilidae megachilinae osmiini including biological comparisons with other osmiine bees ||||| abstract herein we describe the nests including construction closure orientation and depth of cells of the bee osmia ozbekosmia avosetta warncke found nesting near antalya turkey and sepidan iran cells are unusual in that they are lined by two layers of colorful flower petals that sandwich a thin middle layer of mud analyses of pollen taken from scopal hairs of specimens from the turkish site were identified as solely from onobrychis viciifolia scop fabaceae whereas those from the iranian site were from a related plant hedysarum elymaiticum boiss and hausskn these facts coupled with analyses of scopal pollen from other sites in turkey jordan and syria strongly suggest that this bee is oligolectic with respect to the plant tribe hedysareae the egg and last larval instar of osmia avosetta are described the presence of an egg taken from a cell and provisionally identified as belonging to sapyga pulcherrima morawitz suggests that this cleptoparasite may have this bee as one of its hosts in addition we report new information on and review published accounts concerning the use of whole petals or large petal pieces in the construction of cell walls of osmiine bees only osmia ozbekosmia avosetta and species of osmia tergosmia have three layered cell walls with the middle layer made of mud recorded also are the similarities and differences exhibited in pollen and petal preferences and nest characteristics of species in these two related subgenera
characterization of cork warts and aerenchyma in leaves of rhizophora mangle and rhizophora racemosa ||||| abstract mangroves are a diverse group of plants that inhabit tidal zones in the tropics and sub tropics some mangrove species occupy the lower tidal zone in which the substrate is anoxic for long time periods while some mangroves inhabit the upper tidal zone in which the substrate should be less anoxic recent research has shown that about species of mangroves from the americas and from australia transport air internally from openings in leaves called cork warts as air enters leaves it collects within leaf aerenchyma special air spaces within leaves where the air expands when heated by sunlight aerenchyma in leaves is connected to aerenchyma in stems and stilt roots that lead to small roots in the substrate eventually youngest root tissues are aerated while they grow within the anoxic substrate data of this study show that cork warts and leaf aerenchyma develop during leaf initiation in both shoot terminals of branches as well as in viviparous seedlings the number of cork warts per leaf is similar for leaf primordia and for fully enlarged leaves for both rhizophora species tissue sections of leaves of less than mm area show an area of more translucent cells leaves with a surface area of mm show a distinct aerenchyma tissue in which cells have no contents for such leaves the depth of aerenchyma was um with a total leaf depth of um fully enlarged leaves had an aerenchyma depth of about um while the total leaf thickness was about um for all leaves above mm aerenchyma comprised of total leaf volume densities of cork warts were the same for emerging leaf primordia as for fully enlarged leaves the results of this study show that cork warts and aerenchyma develop in leaf primordia of both terminal buds and viviparous seedlings aerenchyma and cork warts become active once they emerge from their stipular coverings
acclimation or innate protection of anemonefishes from sea anemones ||||| studies have shown that anemonefishes can acquire protection from the stinging tentacles of their host anemones through a behavioral process called acclimation however some investigators have suggested that anemonefishes are innately protected from all species of host anemones to definitively test whether anemonefishes are innately protected from anemones we forced naive anemonefishes bred and raised in complete isolation from anemones to contact the tentacles of macrodactyla doreensis heteractis crispa and stichodactyla haddoni individuals of amphiprion clarkii were protected when forced to contact the tentacles of all three anemone species however individuals of a ocellaris and a perideraion were stung by some anemones all fishes went through acclimation behavior after the initial forced contact with anemones thus anemonefishes are innately protected from some anemone species but must acclimate to live with others
self cleaning in tree frog toe pads a mechanism for recovering from contamination without the need for grooming ||||| summary tree frogs use adhesive toe pads for climbing on a variety of surfaces they rely on wet adhesion which is aided by the secretion of mucus in nature the pads will undoubtedly get contaminated regularly through usage but appear to maintain their stickiness over time here we show in two experiments that the toe pads of white s tree frogs litoria caerulea quickly recover from contamination through a self cleaning mechanism we compared adhesive forces prior to and after contamination of the whole animal on a rotatable platform and individual toe pads in restrained frogs mimicking individual steps using a motorised stage in both cases the adhesive forces recovered after a few steps but this took significantly longer in single toe pad experiments from restrained frogs showing that use of the pads increases recovery we propose that both shear movements and a flushing effect of the secreted mucus play an important role in shedding particles contaminants
the origin of traveling waves in an emperor penguin huddle ||||| emperor penguins breed during the antarctic winter and have to endure temperatures as low as c and wind speeds of up to kmh to conserve energy they form densely packed huddles with a triangular lattice structure video recordings from previous studies revealed coordinated movements in regular wave like patterns within these huddles it is thought that these waves are triggered by individual penguins that locally disturb the huddle structure and that the traveling wave serves to remove the lattice defects and restore order the mechanisms that govern wave propagation are currently unknown however moreover it is unknown if the waves are always triggered by the same penguin in a huddle here we present a model in which the observed wave patterns emerge from simple rules involving only the interactions between directly neighboring individuals similar to the interaction rules found in other jammed systems e g between cars in a traffic jam our model predicts that a authors to whom any correspondence should be addressed
ultraviolet reflecting photonic microstructures in the king penguin beak ||||| king and emperor penguins aptenodytes patagonicus and aptenodytes forsteri are the only species of marine birds so far known to reflect ultraviolet uv light from their beaks unlike humans most birds perceive uv light and several species communicate using the near uv spectrum indeed uv reflectance in addition to the colour of songbird feathers has been recognized as an important signal when choosing a mate the king penguin is endowed with several highly coloured ornaments notably its beak horn and breast and auricular plumage but only its beak reflects uv a property considered to influence its sexual attraction because no avian uv reflecting pigments have yet been identified the origin of such reflections is probably structural in an attempt to identify the structures that give rise to uv reflectance we combined reflectance spectrophotometry and morphological analysis by both light and electron microscopy after experimental removal of surface layers of the beak horn here we characterize for the first time a multilayer reflector photonic microstructure that produces the uv reflections in the king penguin beak
honeybee combs construction through a liquid equilibrium process ||||| geometrical investigations of honeycombs and speculations on how honeybees measure and construct the hexagons and rhombi of their cells are centuries old here we show that honeybees neither have to measure nor construct the highly regular structures of a honeycomb and that the observed pattern of combs can be parsimoniously explained by wax flowing in liquid equilibrium the structure of the combs of honeybees results from wax as a thermoplastic building medium which softens and hardens as a result of increasing and decreasing temperatures it flows among an array of transient close packed cylinders which are actually the self heated honeybees themselves the three apparent rhomboids forming the base of each cell do not exist but arise as optical artefacts from looking through semi transparent combs
uptake of water by the lizard moloch horridus ||||| moloch horridusis an agamid lizard living in the desert regions of western and south australia it weighs as much as gm and has been described by buxton as a repulsive animal with tubercles and spines it has the power of absorbing water through the skin after showers of rain this ability of absorbing water through the skin is characteristic of many amphibia and is correlated with a ready loss of water by the same route reptiles living in arid conditions would find a water permeable skin uneconomical for water conservation so that this mode of taking up water may be questioned for moloch
on the utility of the saw of the sawfish ||||| cheeks and opercles silvery the latter with bluish reflections snout entirely transparent except at tip where there is some duskiness that extends a short way backward on sides the colors have changed very little but there is no longer any silver on the opercles which are black due to the black lining of the gill cavity showing through the transparent bones the specimen agrees with the excellent description of the type in all characters not mentioned above
efficacy and safety of catnip nepeta cataria as a novel filth fly repellent ||||| catnip nepeta cataria is known for its pseudo narcotic effects on cats recently it has been reported as an effective mosquito repellent against several aedes and culex species both topically and spatially our laboratory bioassays showed that catnip essential oil at a dosage of mg resulted in average repellency rates of against stable flies stomoxys calcitrans l and against houseflies musca domestica l respectively this finding suggested that the application of repellent could be used as part of filth fly management further evaluations of catnip oil toxicity were conducted to provide a broad spectrum safety profile of catnip oil use as a potential biting and nuisance insect repellent in urban settings acute oral dermal inhalation primary dermal and eye irritation toxicity tests were performed the acute oral ld of catnip oil was found to be mg kg body weight bw and mg kg bw in female and male rats respectively the acute dermal ld was mg kg bw the acute inhalation ld was observed to be mg m primary skin irritation tested on new zealand white rabbits showed that catnip oil is a moderate irritant catnip oil was classified as practically non irritating to the eye in comparison with other u s environmental protection agency approved mosquito repellents deet picaridin and p menthane diol catnip oil can be considered as a relatively safe repellent which may cause minor skin irritation
cold stable eye lens crystallins of the antarctic nototheniid toothfish dissostichus mawsoni norman ||||| summary the eye lenses of the antarctic nototheniid fishes that inhabit the perennially freezing antarctic seawater are transparent at degc whereas the cold sensitive mammalian and tropical fish lenses display cold induced cataract at degc and degc respectively no cold cataract occurs in the giant antarctic toothfish dissostichus mawsoni lens when cooled to temperatures as low as degc indicating highly cold stable lens proteins to investigate this cold stability we characterised the lens crystallin proteins of the antarctic toothfish in parallel with those of the sub tropical bigeye tuna thunnus obesus and the endothermic cow bos taurus representing three disparate thermal climes degc degc and degc respectively sizing chromatography resolved their lens crystallins into three groups a bh b and g with g crystallins being the most abundant lens proteins in fish in contrast to the cow lens where they comprise only the upper thermal stability of these crystallin components correlated with the body temperature of the species in vitro chaperone assays showed that fish a crystallin can protect same species g crystallins from heat denaturation as well as lysozyme from dtt induced unfolding and therefore are small heat shock proteins shsp like their mammalian counterparts dynamic light scattering measured an increase in size of ag crystallin mixtures upon heating which supports formation of the ag complex as an integral part of the chaperone process surprisingly in cross species chaperone assays tunaa crystallins only partly protected toothfish g crystallins while cow a crystallins completely failed to protect indicating partial and no ag interaction respectively toothfish g was likely to be the component that failed to interact as the supernatant from a cowa plus toothfish g incubation could chaperone cow g crystallins in a subsequent heat incubation indicating the presence of uncomplexed cow a this suggests that the inability of toothfish g crystallins to fully complex with tuna a and not at all with the cowa crystallins may have its basis in adaptive changes in the protein that relate to the extreme cold stability of the toothfish lens
positive and negative effects of organisms as physical ecosystem engineers ||||| physical ecosystem engineers are organisms that directly or indirectly control the availability of resources to other organisms by causing physical state changes in biotic or abiotic materials physical ecosystem engineering by organisms is the physical modification maintenance or creation of habitats ecological effects of engineers on many other species occur in virtually all ecosystems because the physical state changes directly create nonfood resources such as living space directly control abiotic resources and indirectly modulate abiotic forces that in turn affect resource use by other organisms trophic interactions and resource competition do not constitute engineering engineering can have significant or trivial effects on other species may involve the physical structure of an organism like a tree or structures made by an organism like a beaver dam and can but does not invariably have feedback effects on the engineer we argue that engineering has both negative and positive effects on species richness and abundances at small scales but the net effects are probably positive at larger scales encompassing engineered and nonengineered environments in ecological and evolutionary space and time models of the population dynamics of engineers suggest that the engineer habitat equilibrium is often but not always locally stable and may show long term cycles with potential ramifications for community and ecosystem stability as yet data adequate to parameterize such a model do not exist for any engineer species because engineers control flows of energy and materials but do not have to participate in these flows energy mass and stoichiometry do not appear to be useful in predicting which engineers will have big effects empirical observations suggest some potential generalizations about which species will be important engineers in which ecosystems we point out some of the obvious and not so obvious ways in which engineering and trophic relations interact and we call for greater research on physical ecosystem engineers their impacts and their interface with trophic relations
a dynamical system for plant pattern formation a rigorous analysis ||||| summarywe present a rigorous mathematical analysis of a discrete dynamical system modeling plant pattern formation in this model based on the work of physicists douady and couder fixed points are the spiral or helical lattices often occurring in plants the frequent occurrence of the fibonacci sequence in the number of visible spirals is explained by the stability of the fixed points in this system as well as by the structure of their bifurcation diagram we provide a detailed study of this diagram
odorant binding proteins from a primitive termite ||||| hitherto odorant binding proteins obps have been identified from insects belonging to more highly evolved insect orders lepidoptera coleoptera diptera hymenoptera and hemiptera whereas only chemosensory proteins have been identified from more primitive species such as orthopteran and phasmid species here we report for the first time the isolation and cloning of odorant binding proteins from a primitive termite species the dampwood termite zootermopsis nevadensis nevadensis isoptera termopsidae a major antennae specific protein was detected by native page along with four other minor proteins which were also absent in the extract from control tissues hindlegs multiple cdna cloning led to the full characterization of the major antennae specific protein znevobp and to the identification of two other antennae specific cdnas encoding putative odorant binding proteins znevobp and znevobp n terminal amino acid sequencing of the minor antennal bands and cdna cloning showed that olfaction in z n nevadensis may involve multiple odorant binding proteins database searches suggest that the obps from this primitive termite are homologues of the pheromone binding proteins from scarab beetles and antennal binding proteins from moths

peptide tag forming a rapid covalent bond to a protein through engineering a bacterial adhesin ||||| protein interactions with peptides generally have low thermodynamic and mechanical stability streptococcus pyogenes fibronectin binding protein fbab contains a domain with a spontaneous isopeptide bond between lys and asp by splitting this domain and rational engineering of the fragments we obtained a peptide spytag which formed an amide bond to its protein partner spycatcher in minutes reaction occurred in high yield simply upon mixing and amidst diverse conditions of ph temperature and buffer spytag could be fused at either terminus or internally and reacted specifically at the mammalian cell surface peptide binding was not reversed by boiling or competing peptide single molecule dynamic force spectroscopy showed that spytag did not separate from spycatcher until the force exceeded nn where covalent bonds snap the robust reaction conditions and irreversible linkage of spytag shed light on spontaneous isopeptide bond formation and should provide a targetable lock in cells and a stable module for new protein architectures
analysis of preload dependent reversible mechanical interlocking using beetle inspired wing locking device ||||| we report an analysis of preload dependent reversible interlocking between regularly arrayed high aspect ratio ar polymer micro and nanofibers such a reversible interlocking is inspired from the wing locking device of a beetle where densely populated microhairs termed microtrichia on the cuticular surface form numerous hair to hair contacts to maximize lateral shear adhesion to mimic this we fabricate various high ar vertical micro and nanopillars on a flexible substrate and investigate the shear locking force with different preloads n cm a simple theoretical model is developed based on the competition between van der waals vdw attraction and deflection forces of pillars which can explain the preload dependent maximum deflection tilting angle and total shear adhesion force
antipredatory properties of an animal architecture how complex faecal cases thwart arthropod attack ||||| animals create a wide variety of structures to deal with abiotic and biotic challenges we evaluated an intriguing structure whose function has never been thoroughly tested specifically we evaluated the hypothesis that the body enclosing faecal case created and lived in by the immature stages of neochlamisus leaf beetles reduces their risk of predation we especially focus on the case of n platani which is externally covered with host plant trichomes and includes a distinct trichome filled chamber attic in the case apex here we separately evaluated the effects of case trichomes and attic on each of several behavioural stages of predator attack using n platani and n bimaculatus larvae and pupae three generalist predators crickets soldier bugs and lynx spiders that represent different feeding strategies were used in our individual level repeated observation behavioural trials results strongly demonstrated that the faecal case itself greatly reduced predation risk for all combinations of beetle species life history stage and predator additional evidence indicated that both trichomes and attics further and independently reduced predation risk variation in results among treatments was also informative for example the capacity of faecal case components to reduce predation sometimes varied markedly among predators and between larval versus pupal life stages patterns of predator behaviour provided no evidence that caseless larvae have alternative means of defence this study further presents a rare example of the co option of a physical plant defence trichomes by an herbivore
coral fluorescent proteins as antioxidants ||||| background a wide array of fluorescent proteins fp is present in anthozoans although their biochemical characteristics and function in host tissue remain to be determined upregulation of fp s frequently occurs in injured or compromised coral tissue suggesting a potential role of coral fps in host stress responses methodology principal findings the presence of fps was determined and quantified for a subsample of seven healthy caribbean coral species using spectral emission analysis of tissue extracts fp concentration was correlated with the in vivo antioxidant potential of the tissue extracts by quantifying the hydrogen peroxide h o scavenging rates fps of the seven species varied in both type and abundance and demonstrated a positive correlation between h o scavenging rate and fp concentration to validate this data the h o scavenging rates of four pure scleractinian fps cyan cfp green gfp red rfp and chromoprotein cp and their mutant counterparts without chromophores were investigated in vitro each fp scavenged h o with the most efficient being cp followed by equivalent activity of cfp and rfp scavenging was significantly higher in all mutant counterparts conclusions significance both naturally occurring and pure coral fps have significant h o scavenging activity the higher scavenging rate of rfp and the cp in vitro is consistent with observed increases of these specific fps in areas of compromised coral tissue however the greater scavenging ability of the mutant counterparts suggests additional roles of scleractinian fps potentially pertaining to their color this study documents h o scavenging of scleractinian fps a novel biochemical characteristic both in vivo across multiple species and in vitro with purified proteins these data support a role for fps in coral stress and immune responses and highlights the multi functionality of these conspicuous proteins
arapaima fish scale one of the toughest flexible biological materials ||||| summary for fish scales to provide protection from predators without severely compromising mobility they must be lightweight flexible and tough the arapaima fish scale is a superb example of this enabling its survival in piranha infested lakes of the amazon these elasmoid scales comprise two layers a laminate composite of parallel collagen fibrils arranged in a bouligand like pattern and a highly mineralized surface layer that prevents initial penetration damage here we measure its j integral fracture toughness and find that the crack growth toughness is kj m representing a very high fracture resistance for a natural material this toughness results from multiple deformation mechanisms acting in concert in the twisted plywood structure of the scale involving the collagenous lamellae at varying orientations retarding crack advance through stretching reorientation delamination and shear and fracture the toughness values obtained for the arapaima scales indicate that they are among the toughest of nature s flexible biological materials
the insect exoskeleton a natural structural composite ||||| through untold centuries of evolutionary development the insect exoskeleton has become a highly optimized structure suited to a variety of demanding duties microscopic examination of the bessbeetle cuticle indicates that it is a composite consisting of layered plies having fiber orientations that alternate in a dual helicoidal pattern further the geometry and size of the reinforcing fibers varies with the position of the ply several interesting structures discovered in the insect exoskeleton may provide fodder for new ideas on composite joining ply orientation and fiber size and geometry
inferring the rules of interaction of shoaling fish ||||| collective motion where large numbers of individuals move synchronously together is achieved when individuals adopt interaction rules that determine how they respond to their neighbors movements and positions these rules determine how group living animals move make decisions and transmit information between individuals nonetheless few studies have explicitly determined these interaction rules in moving groups and very little is known about the interaction rules of fish here we identify three key rules for the social interactions of mosquitofish gambusia holbrooki i attraction forces are important in maintaining group cohesion while we find only weak evidence that fish align with their neighbor s orientation ii repulsion is mediated principally by changes in speed iii although the positions and directions of all shoal members are highly correlated individuals only respond to their single nearest neighbor the last two of these rules are different from the classical models of collective animal motion raising new questions about how fish and other animals self organize on the move
superhydrophobic metallic surfaces and their wetting properties ||||| two scaled polymer patterns possessing high roughness are produced using the hot embossing technique and coating with chromium after covering the rough polymer surface with this metal the resulting surface demonstrates pronounced hydrophobic properties with water drops having apparent contact angles as high as deg as revealed by sem the surface is patterned on two scales which is known to be an important condition for superhydrophobicity of inherently wettable surfaces the modified cassie baxter approach has been used for the present relief the calculated values of the apparent contact angles agree with the observed ones it is important to note that the apparent contact angles almost do not depend on the local contact angles
sensory allometry foraging task specialization and resource exploitation in honeybees ||||| insect societies are important models for evolutionary biology and sociobiology the complexity of some eusocial insect societies appears to arise from self organized task allocation and group cohesion one of the best supported models explaining self organized task allocation in social insects is the response threshold model which predicts specialization due to inter individual variability in sensitivity to task associated stimuli the model explains foraging task specialization among honeybee workers but the factors underlying the differences in individual sensitivity remain elusive here we propose that in honeybees sensory sensitivity correlates with individual differences in the number of sensory structures as it does in solitary species examining european and africanized honeybees we introduce and test the hypothesis that body size and or sensory allometry is associated with foraging task preferences and resource exploitation we focus on common morphological measures and on the size and number of structures associated with olfactory sensitivity we show that the number of olfactory sensilla is greater in pollen and water foragers which are known to exhibit higher sensory sensitivity compared to nectar foragers these differences are independent of the distribution of size within a colony our data also suggest that body mass and number of olfactory sensilla correlate with the concentration of nectar gathered by workers and with the size of pollen loads they carry we conclude that sensory allometry but not necessarily body size is associated with resource exploitation in honeybees and that the differences in number of sensilla may underlie the observed differences in sensitivity between bees specialized on water pollen and nectar collection
bat wing sensors support flight control ||||| bats are the only mammals capable of powered flight and they perform impressive aerial maneuvers like tight turns hovering and perching upside down the bat wing contains five digits and its specialized membrane is covered with stiff microscopically small domed hairs we provide here unique empirical evidence that the tactile receptors associated with these hairs are involved in sensorimotor flight control by providing aerodynamic feedback we found that neurons in bat primary somatosensory cortex respond with directional sensitivity to stimulation of the wing hairs with low speed airflow wing hairs mostly preferred reversed airflow which occurs under flight conditions when the airflow separates and vortices form this finding suggests that the hairs act as an array of sensors to monitor flight speed and or airflow conditions that indicate stall depilation of different functional regions of the bats wing membrane altered the flight behavior in obstacle avoidance tasks by reducing aerial maneuverability as indicated by decreased turning angles and increased flight speed
plant responses to bacterial quorum sensing signals ||||| bacterial infection of plants often depends on the exchange of quorum sensing signals between nearby bacterial cells it is now evident that plants in turn listen to these bacterial signals and respond in sophisticated ways to the information plants also secrete compounds that mimic the bacterial signals and thereby confuse quorum sensing regulation in bacteria
how ticks get under your skin insertion mechanics of the feeding apparatus of ixodes ricinus ticks ||||| the tick ixodes ricinus uses its mouthparts to penetrate the skin of its host and to remain attached for about a week during which time lyme disease spirochaetes may pass from the tick to the host to understand how the tick achieves both tasks penetration and attachment with the same set of implements we recorded the insertion events by cinematography interpreted the mouthparts function by scanning electron microscopy and identified their points of articulation by confocal microscopy our structural dynamic observations suggest that the process of insertion and attachment occurs via a ratchet like mechanism with two distinct stages initially the two telescoping chelicerae pierce the skin and by moving alternately generate a toehold subsequently a breaststroke like motion effected by simultaneous flexure and retraction of both chelicerae pulls in the barbed hypostome this combination of a flexible dynamic mechanical ratchet and a static holdfast thus allows the tick to solve the problem of how to penetrate skin and also remain stuck for long periods of time
survival of the cheapest ||||| abstract most of our resources especially materials are treated by economics as if the supply were infinite when demonstrably it is not for those that are non renewable in his engineering use of materials and energy man lets design takes second place whereas nature treats materials as expensive and designs with apparent care and attention to detail this results in durable materials and cheap structures that are easy to recycle under ambient conditions examples illustrating this principle which are given here are drawn from both animals and plants with comments on the underlying mechanisms such as self assembly of liquid crystal systems use of composite structures and control of fracture properties the natural world of which we are a significant part has many examples of survival with minimum use of energy these examples range from the production and use of materials to the organization of entire populations but not all organisms exist in a half lit miserly half life their that is to say our driving purpose in life is to reproduce and no organism that is me or you would be here unless our parents had a strong urge to reproduce something which we mostly inherit so any way that we can have the largest number of surviving offspring will be favored in doing this we are in competition with nearly all the other organisms in the vicinity the ones with which we are overtly friendly are our immediate genetic or to a lesser extent social relatives and much has been made of the concept that it is our genes rather than ourselves that crave dominance
how do ants stick out their tongues ||||| the mouthparts are very important tools for almost any task performed by ants in particular the labiomaxillary complex is essential for food intake in the present study we investigated the anatomical design of the labiomaxillary complex in various ant species focusing on movement mechanisms six labial and six maxillary muscles with different functions control the several joints and ensure the proper performance of the labiomaxillary complex according to our measurements of sarcomere lengths muscle fiber lengths and diameters and the relative muscle volumes the labial and maxillary muscles feature rather slow than fast muscle characteristics and do not seem to be specialized for specific tasks since glossa protractor muscles are absent the protraction of the glossa the distal end of the labium is a nonmuscular movement by histological measurements of hemolymph volumes we could exclude a pressure driven mechanism additional experiments showed that upon relaxation of the glossa retractor muscles the glossa protracts elastically this elastic mechanism possibly sets an upper limit to licking frequency thus influencing food intake rates and ultimately foraging behavior in contrast to many other elastic mechanisms among arthropods glossa protraction in ants is based on a mechanism where elasticity works as an actual antagonist to muscles we compared the design of the labiomaxillary complex of ants with that of the honeybee and suggest an elastic mechanism for glossa protraction in honeybees as well j morphol c wiley liss inc
egg longevity and time integrated fertilization in a temperate sea urchin strongylocentrotus droebachiensis ||||| recent field experiments have suggested that fertilization levels in sea urchins and other broadcast spawners that release their gametes into the water column may often be far below however past experiments have not considered the potentially positive combined effects of an extended period of egg longevity and the release of gametes in viscous fluids which reduces dilution rates in a laboratory experiment we found that eggs of the sea urchin strongylocentrotus droebachiensis had high viability for to d fertilization levels of eggs held in sperm permeable egg baskets in the field and exposed to sperm slowly diffusing off a spawning male increased significantly with exposure from min to h in a field survey of time integrated fertilizations over and h during natural sperm release events eggs held in baskets accrued fertilizations over as much as h and attained fairly high fertilization levels our results suggest that an extended period of egg longevity and the release of gametes in viscous fluids may result in higher natural fertilization levels than currently expected from short term field experiments
the eyes of oilbirds steatornis caripensis pushing at the limits of sensitivity ||||| an extreme example of a low light level lifestyle among flying birds is provided by the oilbird steatornis caripensis steatornithidae caprimulgiformes oilbirds breed and roost in caves often at sufficient depth that no daylight can penetrate and forage for fruits at night using standard microscopy techniques we investigated the retinal structure of oilbird eyes and used an ophthalmoscopic reflex technique to determine the parameters of these birds visual fields the retina is dominated by small rod receptors diameter mm length mm arranged in a banked structure that is unique among terrestrial vertebrates this arrangement achieves a photoreceptor density that is the highest so far recorded rods mm in any vertebrate eye cone photoreceptors are however present in low numbers the eye is relatively small axial length mm with a maximum pupil diameter of mm achieving a light gathering capacity that is the highest recorded in a bird f number the binocular field has a maximum width of deg and extends vertically through deg with the bill projecting towards the lower periphery a topography that suggests that vision is not used to control bill position we propose that oilbird eyes are at one end of the continuum that juxtaposes the conflicting fundamental visual capacities of sensitivity and resolution thus while oilbird visual sensitivity may be close to a maximum visual resolution must be low this explains why these birds employ other sensory cues including olfaction and echolocation in the control of their behaviour in low light level environments
the great silk alternative multiple co evolution of web loss and sticky hairs in spiders ||||| spiders are the most important terrestrial predators among arthropods their ecological success is reflected by a high biodiversity and the conquest of nearly every terrestrial habitat spiders are closely associated with silk a material often seen to be responsible for their great ecological success and gaining high attention in life sciences however it is often overlooked that more than half of all recent spider species have abandoned web building or never developed such an adaptation these species must have found other more economic solutions for prey capture and retention compensating the higher energy costs of increased locomotion activity here we show that hairy adhesive pads scopulae are closely associated with the convergent evolution of a vagrant life style resulting in highly diversified lineages of at least equal importance as the derived web building taxa previous studies often highlighted the idea that scopulae have the primary function of assisting locomotion neglecting the fact that only the distal most pads claw tufts are suitable for those purposes the former observations that scopulae are used in prey capture are largely overlooked our results suggest the scopulae evolved as a substitute for silk in controlling prey and that the claw tufts are in most cases a secondary development evolutionary trends towards specialized claw tufts and their composition from a low number of enlarged setae to a dense array of slender ones as well as the secondary loss of those pads are discussed further hypotheses about the origin of the adhesive setae and their diversification throughout evolution are provided
