non wetting wings and legs of the cranefly aided by fine structures of the cuticle ||||| non wetting surfaces are imperative to the survival of terrestrial and semi aquatic insects as they afford resistance to wetting by rain and other liquid surfaces that insects may encounter thus there is an evolutionary pay off for these insects to adopt hydrophobic technologies especially on contacting surfaces such as legs and wings the cranefly is a weak flier with many species typically found in wet moist environments where they lay eggs water droplets placed on this insect s wings will spontaneously roll off the surface in addition the insect can stand on water bodies without its legs penetrating the water surface the legs and wings of this insect possess thousands of tiny hairs with intricate surface topographies comprising a series of ridges running longitudinally along the long axis of the hair fibre here we demonstrate that this fine hair structure enhances the ability of the hairs to resist penetration into water bodies
on the electrical conductivity of microbial nanowires and biofilms ||||| dissimilatory metal reducing bacteria dmrb such as geobacter and shewanella spp occupy a distinct metabolic niche in which they acquire energy by coupling oxidation of organic fuels with reduction of insoluble extracellular electron acceptors i e minerals their unique extracellular electron transfer eet capabilities extend to reduction of anodes electrodes maintained at sufficiently positive potentials on which they form persistent electric current generating biofilms one hypothesis describing the mechanism of eet by geobacter and shewanella spp involves superexchange in which electrons are conducted by a succession of electron transfer reactions among redox proteins associated with the outer cell membranes aligned along pilus like filaments e g pili and or throughout the extracellular matrix here we present theory previously developed to describe superexchange within abiotic redox polymers to describe superexchange within dmrb biofilms grown on anodes we show that this theory appears to apply to recent ex situ measurements of electrical conductivity by individual pilus like filaments of s oneidensis mr and g sulfurreducensdl referred to as microbial nanowires microbial nanowires have received much recent attention because they are thought by some to impart electrical conductivity to dmrb biofilms and because of the prospect of microbe produced conductive nanomaterials we also show that this theory appears to apply to preliminary in situ demonstration of electrical conductivity of an anode grown g sulfurreducensdl biofilm based on these results we suggest a role for nanowires of s oneidensis and g sulfurreducens in biofilm conductivity
regulation of constans and flowering locus t expression in response to changing light quality c oa ||||| in addition to pathways that regulate flowering in response to environmental signals such as photoperiod or cold temperatures vernalization flowering time is also regulated by light quality in many species far red fr light is known to accelerate flowering this is environmentally significant because leaves absorb more red light than fr light thus plants growing under a canopy experience light that is enriched in fr light in this article we have explored the promotion of flowering by fr enriched light frel in arabidopsis arabidopsis thaliana previous work has shown that the floral promoter constans co plays a critical role in day length perception and exhibits complex regulation co mrna is regulated by the circadian clock and co protein is stabilized by light and degraded in darkness we find that plants grown under frel contain higher levels of co mrna in the early part of the day than plants under white light furthermore transgenic plants expressing co under the control of a constitutive promoter accumulate higher levels of co protein under frel indicating that frel can increase co protein levels independently of transcription consistent with the model that frel promotes flowering through co mutants for co or gigantea which are required for co transcript accumulation are relatively insensitive to frel because the red fr ratios used in these experiments are in the range of what plants would experience under a canopy these results indicate that the regulation of co by light quality likely plays a key role in the regulation of flowering time in natural environments
the influence of fallback foods on great ape tooth enamel ||||| lucas and colleagues recently proposed a model based on fracture and deformation concepts to describe how mammalian tooth enamel may be adapted to the mechanical demands of diet lucas et al bioessays here we review the applicability of that model by examining existing data on the food mechanical properties and enamel morphology of great apes pan pongo and gorilla particular attention is paid to whether the consumption of fallback foods is likely to play a key role in influencing great ape enamel morphology our results suggest that this is indeed the case we also consider the implications of this conclusion on the evolution of the dentition of extinct hominins
skin and aestivational cocoon of the aquatic amphibian siren intermedia le conte ||||| the skin of siren intermedia is fully metamorphosed amphibian like and specialized in its cocoon producing function during aestivation in burrows in the bottoms of dry ponds epidermal and dermal skin glands secrete a cocoon which covers the entire body except the mouth this structure remarkably like the cocoons of african lungfishes retards desiccation and permits sirens to remain in periodically dry aquatic environments this adaptive strategy may be alternative to that of avoiding drought by overland movement to nearby water
how ants use quorum sensing to estimate the average quality of a fluctuating resource ||||| we show that one of the advantages of quorum based decision making is an ability to estimate the average value of a resource that fluctuates in quality by using a quorum threshold namely the number of ants within a new nest site to determine their choice the ants are in effect voting with their feet our results show that such quorum sensing is compatible with homogenization theory such that the average value of a new nest site is determined by ants accumulating within it when the nest site is of high quality and leaving when it is poor hence the ants can estimate a surprisingly accurate running average quality of a complex resource through the use of extraordinarily simple procedures
formation of sphalerite zns deposits in natural biofilms of sulfate reducing bacteria ||||| abundant micrometer scale spherical aggregates of to nanometer diameter sphalerite zns particles formed within natural biofilms dominated by relatively aerotolerant sulfate reducing bacteria of the family desulfobacteriaceae the biofilm zinc concentration is about times that of associated groundwater to parts per million zinc sphalerite also concentrates arsenic weight and selenium weight the almost monomineralic product results from buffering of sulfide concentrations at low values by sphalerite precipitation these results show how microbes control metal concentrations in groundwater and wetland based remediation systems and suggest biological routes for formation of some low temperature zns deposits
structural design and biomechanics of friction based releasable attachment devices in insects ||||| abstract design of attachment devices in insects varies enormously in relation to different functional loads many systems located on different parts of the body involve surfaces with particular frictional properties such systems evolved to attach parts of the body to each other or to attach an insect to the substratum by providing fast and reversible attachment detachment among these systems there are some that deal with predefined surfaces and others in which one surface remains unpredictable the first type of system occurs for example in wing locking devices and head arresting systems and is called probabilistic fasteners the second type is mainly represented by insect attachment pads of two alternative designs hairy and smooth the relationship between surface patterns and or mechanical properties of materials of contact pairs results in two main working principles of the frictional devices mechanical interlocking or maximization of the contact area we give an overview of the functional design of two main groups of friction based attachment devices in insects probabilistic fasteners and attachment pads
dehydration induced expression of a kda dehydrin in polypodium polypodioides polypodiaceae may enable large reversible deformation of cell walls ||||| current and predicted climate changes caused by global warming compel greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms that plants use to survive drought the desiccation tolerant fern polypodium polypodioides exhibits extensive cell wall folding when dried to less than relative water content rwc and rapidly within h rehydrates when exposed to water and high humidity a kda putative dehydrin polypeptide expressed in partially and fully dry tissues detected via western blotting was present only during drying and rapidly dissipated within h upon tissue rehydration immunostaining indicates the presence of dehydrin near the cell wall of partially and fully dried tissues atomic force microscopy of tracheal scalariform perforations indicates that dry vascular tissue does not undergo significant strain additionally environmental scanning electron microscopy reveals differential hydrophilicity between the abaxial and adaxial leaf surfaces as well as large reversible deformation the ability to avoid cell wall damage in some desiccation tolerant species may be partially attributed to cell wall localization of dehydrins enabling reversible large cell wall deformation thus the de novo synthesis of dehydrin proteins and potential localization to the cell walls of these desiccation tolerant species may play a role in avoiding mechanical failure during drought
nacre from mollusk shells a model for high performance structural materials ||||| nacre is the iridescent layer found inside a large number of mollusk shells this natural composite has a very high mineral content which makes it hard and stiff however it is the toughness of nacre which is the most impressive it is three orders of magnitude tougher than the mineral it is made of no manmade composite material can boast such amplification in toughness and for this reason nacre has become a biomimetic model material the mineral in nacre comes in the form of microscopic polygonal tablets which have the ability to slide on one another in large numbers when the material is loaded in tension this key mechanism makes nacre a quasi ductile material which in turn greatly increases its toughness and makes it damage tolerant numerous artificial nacres were developed in the past but none of them can truly duplicate the remarkable mechanism of tablet sliding in this work selected structural features of nacre were implemented in a pmma based composite which for the first time could replicate the collective tablet sliding mechanism this material demonstrates that the powerful toughening mechanism operating in natural nacre can be duplicated and harnessed in engineering materials
control of the selectivity of the aquaporin water channel family by global orientational tuning ||||| aquaporins are transmembrane channels found in cell membranes of all life forms we examine their apparently paradoxical property facilitation of efficient permeation of water while excluding protons which is of critical importance to preserving the electrochemical potential across the cell membrane we have determined the structure of the escherichia coliaquaglyceroporin glpf with bound water in native angstroms and in w f f t mutant angstroms forms and carried out nanosecond molecular dynamics simulations that define the spatial and temporal probability distribution and orientation of a single file of seven to nine water molecules inside the channel two conserved asparagines force a central water molecule to serve strictly as a hydrogen bond donor to its neighboring water molecules assisted by the electrostatic potential generated by two half membrane spanning loops this dictates opposite orientations of water molecules in the two halves of the channel and thus prevents the formation of a proton wire while permitting rapid water diffusion both simulations and observations revealed a more regular distribution of channel water and an increased water permeability for the w f f t mutant
the calvin cycle revisited ||||| the sequence of reactions in the calvin cycle and the biochemical characteristics of the enzymes involved have been known for some time however the extent to which any individual enzyme controls the rate of carbon fixation has been a long standing question over the last years antisense transgenic plants have been used as tools to address this and have revealed some unexpected findings about the calvin cycle it was shown that under a range of environmental conditions the level of rubisco protein had little impact on the control of carbon fixation in addition three of the four thioredoxin regulated enzymes fbpase prkase and gapdh had negligible control of the cycle unexpectedly non regulated enzymes catalysing reversible reactions aldolase and transketolase both exerted significant control over carbon flux furthermore under a range of growth conditions sbpase was shown to have a significant level of control over the calvin cycle these data led to the hypothesis that increasing the amounts of these enzymes may lead to an increase in photosynthetic carbon assimilation remarkably photosynthetic capacity and growth were increased in tobacco plants expressing a bifunctional sbpase fbpase enzyme future work is discussed which will further our understanding of this complex and important pathway particularly in relation to the mechanisms that regulate and co ordinate enzyme activity
characterization of an electron conduit between bacteria and the extracellular environment ||||| a number of species of gram negative bacteria can use insoluble minerals of fe iii and mn iv as extracellular respiratory electron acceptors in some species of shewanella deca heme electron transfer proteins lie at the extracellular face of the outer membrane om where they can interact with insoluble substrates to reduce extracellular substrates these redox proteins must be charged by the inner membrane periplasmic electron transfer system here we present a spectro potentiometric characterization of a trans om icosa heme complex mtrcab and demonstrate its capacity to move electrons across a lipid bilayer after incorporation into proteoliposomes we also show that a stable mtrab subcomplex can assemble in the absence of mtrc an mtrbc subcomplex is not assembled in the absence of mtra and mtra is only associated to the membrane in cells when mtrb is present we propose a model for the modular organization of the mtrcab complex in which mtrc is an extracellular element that mediates electron transfer to extracellular substrates and mtrb is a trans om spanning b barrel protein that serves as a sheath within which mtra and mtrc exchange electrons we have identified the mtrab module in a range of bacterial phyla suggesting that it is widely used in electron exchange with the extracellular environment
allelochemicals released by rice roots and residues in soil ||||| a few rice oryza sativa l varieties or rice straw produce and release allelochemicals into soil in which interfere with the growth of neighboring or successive plants allelopathic rice pi and huagan at their early growth stages released momilactone b isopropyl acetoxycyclohexene one and trihydroxy dimethoxyflavone into soil at phytotoxic levels but non allelopathic rice huajingxian did not both allelopathic and non allelopathic rice residues released momilactone b and lignin related phenolic acids p hydroxybenzoic p coumaric ferulic syringic and vanillic acids into the soil during residue decomposition to inhibit successive plants the results indicated that allelochemicals involved in rice allelopathy from living and dead plants are substantially different interestingly the concentrations of the allelochemicals released from the allelopathic rice seedlings in soil increased dramatically when they were surrounded with echinochloa crus galli the concentrations of the allelochemicals were over fold higher in the presence of e crus galli than in the absence of e crus galli however the same case did not occur in non allelopathic huajingxian seedlings surrounded with e crus galli in addition to allelochemical exudation being promoted by the presence of e crus galli allelopathic rice seedlings also increased allelochemical exudation in response to exudates of germinated e crus galli seeds or lepidimoide an uronic acid derivative exuded from e crus galli seeds these results imply that allelopathic rice seedlings can sense certain allelochemicals released by e crus galli into the soil and respond by increased production of allelochemicals inhibitory to e crus galli this study suggests that rice residues of both allelopathic and non allelopathic varieties release similar concentrations and types of allelochemicals to inhibit successive plants in contrast living rice plants of certain allelopathic varieties appear to be able to detect the presence of interspecific neighbors and respond by increased allelochemicals
bacterial bioluminescence regulates expression of a host cryptochrome gene in the squid vibrio symbiosis ||||| abstract the symbiosis between the squid euprymna scolopes and its luminous symbiont vibrio fischeri is characterized by daily transcriptional rhythms in both partners and daily fluctuations in symbiont luminescence in this study we sought to determine whether symbionts affect host transcriptional rhythms we identified two transcripts in host tissues e scolopes cry escry and escry that encode cryptochromes proteins that influence circadian rhythms in other systems both genes cycled daily in the head of the squid with a pattern similar to that of other animals in which expression of certain cry genes is entrained by environmental light in contrast escry expression cycled in the symbiont colonized light organ with fold upregulation coincident with the rhythms of bacterial luminescence which are offset from the day night light regime colonization of the juvenile light organ by symbionts was required for induction of escry cycling further analysis with a mutant strain defective in light production showed that symbiont luminescence is essential for cycling of escry this defect could be complemented by presentation of exogenous blue light however blue light exposure alone did not induce cycling in nonsymbiotic animals but addition of molecules of the symbiont cell envelope to light exposed animals did recover significant cycling activity showing that light acts in synergy with other symbiont features to induce cycling while symbiont luminescence may be a character specific to rhythms of the squid vibrio association resident microbial partners could similarly influence well documented daily rhythms in other systems such as the mammalian gut importance in mammals biological rhythms of the intestinal epithelium and the associated mucosal immune system regulate such diverse processes as lipid trafficking and the immune response to pathogens while these same processes are affected by the diverse resident microbiota the extent to which these microbial communities control or are controlled by these rhythms has not been addressed this study provides evidence that the presentation of three bacterial products lipid a peptidoglycan monomer and blue light is required for cyclic expression of a cryptochrome gene in the symbiotic organ the finding that bacteria can directly influence the transcription of a gene encoding a protein implicated in the entrainment of circadian rhythms provides the first evidence for the role of bacterial symbionts in influencing and perhaps driving peripheral circadian oscillators in the host in mammals biological rhythms of the intestinal epithelium and the associated mucosal immune system regulate such diverse processes as lipid trafficking and the immune response to pathogens while these same processes are affected by the diverse resident microbiota the extent to which these microbial communities control or are controlled by these rhythms has not been addressed this study provides evidence that the presentation of three bacterial products lipid a peptidoglycan monomer and blue light is required for cyclic expression of a cryptochrome gene in the symbiotic organ the finding that bacteria can directly influence the transcription of a gene encoding a protein implicated in the entrainment of circadian rhythms provides the first evidence for the role of bacterial symbionts in influencing and perhaps driving peripheral circadian oscillators in the host
helminths and the ibd hygiene hypothesis ||||| na helminths are parasitic animals that have evolved over years to live in the intestinal track or other locations of their hosts colonization of humans with these organisms was nearly universal until the early th century more than people in less developed countries carry helminths even today helminths must quell their host s immune system to successfully colonize it is likely that helminths sense hostile changes in the local host environment and take action to control such responses inflammatory bowel disease ibd probably results from an inappropriately vigorous immune response to contents of the intestinal lumen environmental factors strongly affect the risk for ibd people living in less developed countries are protected from ibd the ibd hygiene hypothesis states that raising children in extremely hygienic environments negatively affects immune development which predisposes them to immunological diseases like ibd later in life modern day absence of exposure to intestinal helminths appears to be an important environmental factor contributing to development of these illnesses helminths interact with both host innate and adoptive immunity to stimulate immune regulatory circuitry and to dampen effector pathways that drive aberrant inflammation the first prototype worm therapies directed against immunological diseases are now under study in the united states and various countries around the world additional studies are in the advanced planning stage
mechanism of infrared detection and transduction by beetle melanophila acuminata ||||| the melanophila acuminata beetle is attracted to forest fires via a pair of infrared sensory organs composed of sensilla our histological work showed that each sensillum contains lipid layers surrounding a protein layer and a unique polysaccharide base that is associated with a neuron to each sensillum infrared microscopy showed that the protein region maximally absorbs infrared radiation at mm wavelength and at mm which corresponds to the known radiation produced by forest fires at mm mathematical calculations showed that the physical properties of the sensilla are such that the expected temperature rise is insufficient for transduction of the infrared signal through mechanical means or as a thermal receptor as previously thought hence the protein plays the pivotal role in perception of single photons and transmission of the signal within the sensilla
the aerodynamics of wind pollination ||||| a number of morphologic features have evolved in evolutionarily divergent plant groups that appear to increase the efficiency of wind pollination among these features are the appearance of low density pollen grains female ovulate organs that direct air currents carrying pollen toward stigmas or micropyles and population structures with a high density of con specifics this paper reviews the aerodynamic theory and the experimental and field data that are relevant to an understanding of the adaptive significance of these and other features of anemophily emphasis is placed on the mathematical description of the behavior of airflow patterns around ovulate organs the efficiency of wind pollination is shown to be dictated principally by the vectoral properties of air currents created by and around ovulate organs and the physical properties of pollen that dictate their behavior as airborne particles abstrakteine anzahl von morphologischen kennzeichen die effizienz der windpollination zu steigern scheinen haben sich in evolutionar ausenandergehonden pflanzengruppen entwickelt zu diesen kennzeichen gehoren die erscheinung von pollenkornen von geringer dichte weiblichen organen die pollentragende luftstromungen zu den stigmas oder micropylen dirigieren und bevolkerungsstrukturen mit grosser dichte von con specifics diese abhandlung gibt einen uberblick der aerodynamischen theorie und der experimentelle werte die fur das verstandnis der adaptiven signifikanz dieser und anderer kennzeichen der windpollination von bedeutung sind betont wird die mathematische beschreibung des verhaltens der luftstromungen um die weiblichen organe es wird gezeigt dass die effizienz der windpollination hauptsachlich durch die vectoralen eigenschaften der luftstromungen die durch und um die weiblichen organe entstehen bestimmt wird und durch die physischen eigenschaften des pollens die sein verhalten als luftgetragene partikel diktieren
protein phylogenetic analysis of ca cation antiporters and insights into their evolution in plants ||||| cation transport is a critical process in all organisms and is essential for mineral nutrition ion stress tolerance and signal transduction transporters that are members of the ca cation antiporter caca superfamily are involved in the transport of ca and or other cations using the counter exchange of another ion such as h or na the caca superfamily has been previously divided into five transporter families the yrbg na ca exchanger ncx na ca k exchanger nckx h cation exchanger cax and cation ca exchanger ccx families which include the well characterized ncx and cax transporters to examine the evolution of caca transporters within higher plants and the green plant lineage caca genes were identified from the genomes of sequenced flowering plants a bryophyte lycophyte and freshwater and marine algae and compared with those from non plant species we found evidence of the expansion and increased diversity of flowering plant genes within the cax and ccx families genes related to the ncx family are present in land plant though they encode distinct mhx homologs which probably have an altered transport function in contrast the ncx and nckx genes which are absent in land plants have been retained in many species of algae especially the marine algae indicating that these organisms may share animal like characteristics of ca homeostasis and signaling a group of genes encoding novel cax like proteins containing an ef hand domain were identified from plants and selected algae but appeared to be lacking in any other species lack of functional data for most of the caca proteins make it impossible to reliably predict substrate specificity and function for many of the groups or individual proteins the abundance and diversity of caca genes throughout all branches of life indicates the importance of this class of cation transporter and that many transporters with novel functions are waiting to be discovered
energetic cost of locomotion in kangaroos ||||| the hopping of kangaroos is reminiscent of a bouncing ball or the action of a pogo stick this suggests a significant storage and recovery of energy in elastic elements one might surmise that the kangaroo s first hop would require a large amount of energy whereas subsequent hops could rely extensively on elastic rebound if this were the case then the kangaroo s unusual saltatory mode of locomotion should be an energetically inexpensive way to move
restoration of tensile strength in bark samples of ficus benjamina due to coagulation of latex during fast self healing of fissures ||||| background and aims the functions of plant latex have been discussed for a long time today many studies support a defence mechanism as being its main function a role as a self healing mechanism was never attributed to the coagulation of latex in this study we quantified the contribution of the coagulation of ficus benjamina weeping fig latex to a restoration of the mechanical properties of the bark after external lesions methods tensile tests of f benjamina bark were conducted either immediately after injury or at various latency times after injury key results a significant increase in the tensile strength of bark samples until min after injury was found and this effect could be attributed to the coagulation of plant latex alone the tensile strength remains nearly constant until several hours or days after injury then very probably due to other mechanisms such as cell growth and cell proliferation the tensile strength begins to increase slightly again conclusions the coagulation of latex seals lesions and serves as a quick and effective pre step of subsequent more effective long lasting self healing mechanisms such as cell growth and proliferation thus a fast self healing effect can be included in the list of functions of plant latex
contribution of the alternative pathway to respiration during thermogenesis in flowers of the sacred lotus ||||| we report results from in vivo measurements using oxygen isotope discrimination techniques of fluxes through the alternative and cytochrome respiratory pathways in thermogenic plant tissue the floral receptacle of the sacred lotus nelumbo nucifera fluxes through both pathways were measured in thermoregulating flowers undergoing varying degrees of thermogenesis in response to ambient temperature significant increases in alternative pathway flux were found in lotus receptacles with temperatures degc to degc above ambient but not in those with lesser amounts of heating alternative pathway flux in the hottest receptacles was of the total respiratory flux in contrast fluxes through the cytochrome pathway did not change significantly during thermogenesis these data support the hypothesis that increased flux through the alternative pathway is responsible for heating in the lotus and that it is unlikely that uncoupling proteins which would have produced increased fluxes through the cytochrome pathway contribute significantly to heating in this tissue comparisons of actual flux with capacity determined using inhibitors suggested that the alternative pathway was operating at close to maximum capacity in heating tissues of lotus however in nonheating tissues the inhibitor data significantly overestimated the alternative pathway flux this confirms that isotopic measurements are necessary for accurate determination of fluxes through the two pathways
hydrogen and bioenergetics in the yellowstone geothermal ecosystem ||||| the geochemical energy budgets for high temperature microbial ecosystems such as occur at yellowstone national park have been unclear to address the relative contributions of different geochemistries to the energy demands of these ecosystems we draw together three lines of inference we studied the phylogenetic compositions of high temperature degrees c communities in yellowstone hot springs with distinct chemistries conducted parallel chemical analyses and carried out thermodynamic modeling results of extensive molecular analyses taken with previous results show that most microbial biomass in these systems as reflected by rrna gene abundance is comprised of organisms of the kinds that derive energy for primary productivity from the oxidation of molecular hydrogen h the apparent dominance by h metabolizing organisms indicates that h is the main source of energy for primary production in the yellowstone high temperature ecosystem hydrogen concentrations in the hot springs were measured and found to range up to nm consistent with this hypothesis thermodynamic modeling with environmental concentrations of potential energy sources also is consistent with the proposed microaerophilic hydrogen based energy economy for this geothermal ecosystem even in the presence of high concentrations of sulfide
conversion of dibenzothiophene by the mushrooms agrocybe aegerita and coprinellus radians and their extracellular peroxygenases ||||| the conversion of the heterocycle dibenzothiophene dbt by the agaric basidiomycetes agrocybe aegerita and coprinellus radians was studied in vivo and in vitro with whole cells and with purified extracellular peroxygenases respectively a aegerita oxidized dbt mm by within days into eight different metabolites among the latter were mainly s oxidation products dbt sulfoxide dbt sulfone and in lower amounts ring hydroxylation compounds e g hydroxy dbt c radians converted about of dbt into dbt sulfoxide and dbt sulfone as the sole metabolites in vitro tests with purified peroxygenases were performed to compare the product pattern with the metabolites formed in vivo using ascorbic acid as radical scavenger a total of and seven oxygenation products were detected after dbt conversion by the peroxygenases of a aegerita aap and c radians crp respectively whereas ring hydroxylation was favored over s oxidation by aap again hydroxy dbt was identified crp formed dbt sulfoxide as major product this finding suggests that fungal peroxygenases can considerably differ in their catalytic properties using h o the origin of oxygen was proved to be the peroxide based on these results we propose that extracellular peroxygenases may be involved in the oxidation of heterocycles by fungi also under natural conditions
a predator from east africa that chooses malaria vectors as preferred prey ||||| background all vectors of human malaria a disease responsible for more than one million deaths per year are female mosquitoes from the genus anopheles evarcha culicivora is an east african jumping spider salticidae that feeds indirectly on vertebrate blood by selecting blood carrying female mosquitoes as preferred prey methodology principal findings by testing with motionless lures made from mounting dead insects in lifelike posture on cork discs we show that e culicivora selects anopheles mosquitoes in preference to other mosquitoes and that this predator can identify anopheles by static appearance alone tests using active grooming virtual mosquitoes rendered in d animation show that anopheles characteristic resting posture is an important prey choice cue for e culicivora expression of the spider s preference for anopheles varies with the spider s size varies with its prior feeding condition and is independent of the spider gaining a blood meal conclusions significance this is the first experimental study to show that a predator of any type actively chooses anopheles as preferred prey suggesting that specialized predators having a role in the biological control of disease vectors is a realistic possibility
bill sweeping in spoonbills platalea no evidence for an effective suction force at the tip ||||| we analysed the hypothesis of weihs and katzir that feeding spoonbills use their broad bills by sweeping it through the water to shed a vortex this would result in a hydrodynamic suction on the bottom for catching prey immediately or during the next sweep besides providing some extra benefits the basic assumptions appear to be erroneous a spoonbill does not mainly feed on small benthic invertebrates but mainly on nekton such as fish and shrimps the inner surface of the upper mandible of a spoonbill is not concave but convex during feeding a spoonbill does not keep its bill tip close to the bottom independent of the water depth the outcomes of the tests supporting the hypothesis do not hold and the suggested benefits are dubious therefore we reject the hypothesis and the claim that the bill of a spoonbill is used as a hydrofoil the discussed paper tried to give an explanation of the behaviour of a bird with the help of hydrodynamic formulae the fundamental mistake in the paper is that the use of the formulae is based on wrong assumptions concerning the food of the bird its feeding behaviour as well as its anatomical details the tests with a bird kept in captivity suggesting a proof of the rightness of the hypothesis lack a proper connection to the situation in the wild spoonbills aves ciconiiformes threskiornithidae genus platalea are large wading birds characterised by their extremely flattened bills that are widened in the distal parts the six species are very similar in shape and behaviour mainly differing in size colour of legs bills and other bare parts and in distribution matheu and del hoyo they feed tactilely by walking in shallow
identification and characterization of a multidomain hyperthermophilic cellulase from an archaeal enrichment ||||| despite extensive studies on microbial and enzymatic lignocellulose degradation relatively few archaea are known to deconstruct crystalline cellulose here we describe a consortium of three hyperthermophilic archaea enriched from a continental geothermal source by growth at degc on crystalline cellulose representing the first instance of archaea able to deconstruct lignocellulose optimally above degc following metagenomic studies on the consortium a kda multidomain cellulase annotated as a member of the tim barrel glycosyl hydrolase superfamily was characterized the multidomain architecture of this protein is uncommon for hyperthermophilic endoglucanases and two of the four domains of the enzyme have no characterized homologues the recombinant enzyme has optimal activity at degc a half life of h at degc and resists denaturation in strong detergents high salt concentrations and ionic liquids cellulases active above degc may assist in biofuel production from lignocellulosic feedstocks by hydrolysing cellulose under conditions typically employed in biomass pretreatment
proposed carbon dioxide concentrating mechanism in chlamydomonas reinhardtii ||||| aquatic photosynthetic microorganisms account for almost of the world s photosynthesis these organisms face several challenges in acquiring co from the environment the first challenge is presented by the properties of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase rubisco rubisco is
evolution of the dragonfly head arresting system ||||| the arrester or fixation system of the head in adult odonata is unique among arthropods this system involves the organs of two body segments the head and the neck it consists of a skeleton muscle apparatus that sets the arrester parts in motion the parts comprise formations covered with complicated microstructures fields of microtrichia on the rear surface of the head and post cervical sclerites of the neck the arrester immobilizes the head during feeding or when the dragonfly is in tandem flight thus it may serve as an adaptation to save the head from violent mechanical disturbance and to stabilize gaze in a variety of behavioural situations this study shows the evolutionary trend of the arrester in the order odonata by using scanning electron microscopy and measurements of arrester structures in species from odonate families the arrester design occurring in the epiophlebiidae gomphidae neopetaliidae petaluridae and chlorogomphinae is suggested to be the basic one two convergent pathways of head arrester evolution among zygoptera and anisoptera are proposed the possible functional significance of the arrester system is discussed
vertical jumping in galago senegalensis the quest for an obligate mechanical power amplifier ||||| bushbabies galago senegalensis are renowned for their phenomenal jumping capacity it was postulated that mechanical power amplification must be involved dynamic analysis of the vertical jumps performed by two bushbabies confirms the need for a power amplifier inverse dynamics coupled to a geometric musculo skeletal model were used to elucidate the precise nature of the mechanism powering maximal vertical jumps most of the power required for jumping is delivered by the vastus muscle tendon systems knee extensor comparison with the external joint powers revealed however an important power transport from this extensor about to the ankle and the midfoot via the bi articular calf muscles peak power output likely implies elastic recoil of the complex aponeurotic system of the vastus muscle patterns of changes in length and tension of the muscle tendon complex during different phases of the jump were found which provide strong evidence for substantial power amplification times it is argued here that the multiple internal connective tissue sheets and attachment structures of the well developed bundles of the vastus muscle become increasingly stretched during preparatory crouching and throughout the extension phase except for the last ms of the push off i e when power requirements peak then tension in the knee extensors abruptly falls from its maximum allowing the necessary fast recoil of the tensed tendon structures to occur
morphological and kinematic basis of the hummingbird flight stroke scaling of flight muscle transmission ratio ||||| hummingbirds trochilidae are widely known for their insect like flight strokes characterized by high wing beat frequency small muscle strains and a highly supinated wing orientation during upstroke that allows for lift production in both halves of the stroke cycle here we show that hummingbirds achieve these functional traits within the limits imposed by a vertebrate endoskeleton and muscle physiology by accentuating a wing inversion mechanism found in other birds and using long axis rotational movement of the humerus in hummingbirds long axis rotation of the humerus creates additional wing translational movement supplementing that produced by the humeral elevation and depression movements of a typical avian flight stroke this adaptation increases the wing to muscle transmission ratio and is emblematic of a widespread scaling trend among flying animals whereby wing to muscle transmission ratio varies inversely with mass allowing animals of vastly different sizes to accommodate aerodynamic biomechanical and physiological constraints on muscle powered flapping flight
plant hydraulics the ascent of water ||||| when you re a large organism and made of wood you can t have a heart or other contractile organs but you still need to move fluids to live how is this done
mushrooms as rainmakers how spores act as nuclei for raindrops ||||| millions of tons of fungal spores are dispersed in the atmosphere every year these living cells along with plant spores and pollen grains may act as nuclei for condensation of water in clouds basidiospores released by mushrooms form a significant proportion of these aerosols particularly above tropical forests mushroom spores are discharged from gills by the rapid displacement of a droplet of fluid on the cell surface this droplet is formed by the condensation of water on the spore surface stimulated by the secretion of mannitol and other hygroscopic sugars this fluid is carried with the spore during discharge but evaporates once the spore is airborne using environmental electron microscopy we have demonstrated that droplets reform on spores in humid air the kinetics of this process suggest that basidiospores are especially effective as nuclei for the formation of large water drops in clouds through this mechanism mushroom spores may promote rainfall in ecosystems that support large populations of ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic basidiomycetes our research heightens interest in the global significance of the fungi and raises additional concerns about the sustainability of forests that depend on heavy precipitation
platelet interlocks are the key to toughness and strength in nacre ||||| nacre the inner layer of mollusk shells is a composite made of platelets of mineral aragonitic calcium carbonate with a few weight percent organic material sandwiched in between the organic and nanostructural nuances are often suggested to be the reason for the extreme toughness of nacre here we report the presence of interlocks between platelets of nacre from red abalone we also report and show using three dimensional finite element modeling that interlocks are the key mechanism for the high toughness and strength of nacre the observed rotation between platelet layers which were earlier reported as defects of structure are necessary for the formation of interlocks
total internal reflection accounts for the bright color of the saharan silver ant ||||| the saharan silver ant cataglyphis bombycina is one of the terrestrial living organisms best adapted to tolerate high temperatures it has recently been shown that the hairs covering the ant s dorsal body part are responsible for its silvery appearance the hairs have a triangular cross section with two corrugated surfaces allowing a high optical reflection in the visible and near infrared nir range of the spectrum while maximizing heat emissivity in the mid infrared mir those two effects account for remarkable thermoregulatory properties enabling the ant to maintain a lower thermal steady state and to cope with the high temperature of its natural habitat in this paper we further investigate how geometrical optical and high reflection properties account for the bright silver color of c bombycina using optical ray tracing models and attenuated total reflection atr experiments we show that for a large range of incidence angles total internal reflection tir conditions are satisfied on the basal face of each hair for light entering and exiting through its upper faces the reflection properties of the hairs are further enhanced by the presence of the corrugated surface giving them an almost total specular reflectance for most incidence angles we also show that hairs provide an almost fold increase in light reflection and we confirm experimentally that they are responsible for a lower internal body temperature under incident sunlight overall this study improves our understanding of the optical mechanisms responsible for the silver color of c bombycina and the remarkable thermoregulatory properties of the hair coat covering the ant s body

domes arches and urchins the skeletal architecture of echinoids echinodermata ||||| summarya combination of simple membrane theory and statical analysis has been used to determine how stresses are carried in echinoid skeletons sutures oriented circumferentially are subject principally to compression those forming radial zig zags are subject to compression near the apex and tension near the ambitus radial and circumferential sutures in eucidaris are equally bound with collagen fibers but in diadema tripneustes psammechinus arbacia and other regular echinoids most radial sutures are more heavily bound and thus stronger in tension psammechinus tripneustes and several other echinoids have radial sutures thickened by ribs which increase the area of interlocking trabeculae ribs also increase flexural stiffness and carry a greater proportion of the stress further ribs effectively draw stress from weaker areas pierced by podial pores and increase the total load which can be sustained allometry indicates that regular echinoids become relatively higher at the apex as size increases thus reducing ambital stresses some spatangoids with very high domes eg agassizia maintain isometry but others eg meoma become flatter with size both holectypoids echinoneus and cassiduloids apatopygus maintain a constant height to diameter relationship flattening and consequently ambital tensile stress is greatest in the clypeasteroids in this group the formation of internal buttresses which preferentially carry stress reaches maximum development a notable exception however is the high domed clypeaster rosaceus in this analysis it was assumed that local buckling or bending does not occur the test of some echinoids e g diadematoida have relatively wide sutures swathed in collagen which allows local deformation others e g arbacia have rigid sutures with reduced collagen in psammechinus and other members of the order echinoida in addition to rib formation inner and outer surface trabeculae are thickened so that the individual plates are stiffened some spatangoids meoma paleopneustes have extensive sutural collagen but the cassiduloid apatopygus has collagen confined to junctions of sutures and elsewhere the joints are strengthened and stiffened by fusion of trabeculae fusion of surface trabeculae is almost complete in the holectypoid echinoneus and the sutures are obscured
the mechanics of explosive dispersal and self burial in the seeds of the filaree erodium cicutarium geraniaceae ||||| summary the filaree erodium cicutarium a small flowering plant related to geraniums possesses a unique seed dispersal mechanism the plant can fling its seeds up to half a meter away and the seeds can bury themselves by drilling into the ground twisting and untwisting in response to changes in humidity these feats are accomplished using awns helical bristles of dead but hygroscopically active tissue attached to the seeds here we describe the kinematics of explosive dispersal and self burial based on detailed high speed and time lapse videos we use these observations to develop a simple mechanical model that accounts for the coiling behavior of the awn and allows comparison of the strain energy stored in the awn with the kinetic energy at launch the model is used to examine tradeoffs between dispersal distance and reliability of the dispersal mechanism the mechanical model may help in understanding the invasive potential of this species and provides a framework for examining other evolutionary tradeoffs in seed dispersal mechanisms among the geraniaceae
directionally controlled fluorescence emission in butterflies ||||| recently developed high efficiency light emitting diodes use two dimensional photonic crystals to enhance the extraction of otherwise internally trapped light and multilayer reflectors to control the direction of light emission this work describes the characterization of a naturally evolved light extraction system on the wing scales of a small group of papilio butterflies the efficient extraction of fluorescence from these scales is facilitated by a two dimensional photonic crystal slab that uses a multilayer to help control emission direction its light extraction function is analogous to that of the light emitting diode
shooting mechanisms in nature a systematic review ||||| background in nature shooting mechanisms are used for a variety of purposes including prey capture defense and reproduction this review offers insight into the working principles of shooting mechanisms in fungi plants and animals in the light of the specific functional demands that these mechanisms fulfill methods we systematically searched the literature using scopus and web of knowledge to retrieve articles about solid projectiles that either are produced in the body of the organism or belong to the body and undergo a ballistic phase the shooting mechanisms were categorized based on the energy management prior to and during shooting results shooting mechanisms were identified with projectile masses ranging from mg in spores of the fungal phyla ascomycota and zygomycota to approximately mg for the ballistic tongue of the toad bufo alvarius the energy for shooting is generated through osmosis in fungi plants and animals or muscle contraction in animals osmosis can be induced by water condensation on the system in fungi or water absorption in the system reaching critical pressures up to atmospheres observed in fungi plants and animals or water evaporation from the system reaching up to atmospheres observed in plants and fungi the generated energy is stored as elastic potential energy in cell walls in fungi and plants and in elastic structures in animals with two exceptions in the momentum catapult of basidiomycota the energy is stored in a stalk hilum by compression of the spore and droplets and in sphagnum energy is mainly stored in compressed air finally the stored energy is transformed into kinetic energy of the projectile using a catapult mechanism delivering up to j kg in the osmotic shooting mechanism in cnidarians and j kg in the muscle powered appendage strike of the mantis shrimp odontodactylus scyllarus the launch accelerations range from g in the frog rana pipiens to g in cnidarians the launch velocities from m s in the fungal phylum basidiomycota to m s in the mulberry morus alba and the launch distances from a few thousands of a millimeter in basidiomycota to m in the rainforest tree tetraberlinia moreliana the mass specific power outputs range from w kg in the water evaporation mechanism in basidiomycota to w kg in cnidarians using water absorption as energy source discussion and conclusions the magnitude of accelerations involved in shooting is generally scale dependent with the smaller the systems discharging the microscale projectiles generating the highest accelerations the mass specific power output is also scale dependent with smaller mechanisms being able to release the energy for shooting faster than larger mechanisms whereas the mass specific work delivered by the shooting mechanism is mostly independent of the scale of the shooting mechanism higher mass specific work values are observed in osmosis powered shooting mechanisms j kg when compared to muscle powered mechanisms j kg the achieved launch parameters acceleration velocity and distance as well as the associated delivered power output and work thus depend on the working principle and scale of the shooting mechanism
nitrogen mineralization ammonia accumulation and emission of gaseous nh by soil feeding termites ||||| there are numerous reports on the accumulation of ammonia in the mounds of soil feeding termites here we provided direct evidence for an effective mineralization of nitrogenous soil organic matter in the gut of cubitermes spp which gives rise to enormous ammonia concentrations in the intestinal tract in cubitermes ugandensis the ammonia content of the nest material mmol g dry wt was about fold higher than that of the parent soil large amounts of ammonia were present throughout the intestinal tract with lowest values in the extremely alkaline gut sections ph and highest values posterior hindgut mmol g dry wt results obtained with other cubitermes species were similar ammonia concentrations in the posterior hindgut of these humivorous species up to mm are among the highest values ever reported for soil macroinvertebrates and are matched only by insects feeding on an extremely protein rich diet e g the sarcophageous larvae of blowflies volatilization of ammonia about nmol g fresh wt h either directly by emission from the termite body or indirectly from their feces led to nh concentrations in the nest atmosphere of c ugandensis that were three orders of magnitude above the ambient background a relative accumulation that is considerably higher than that observed with ch and co together with previous results these observations document that through their feeding activity and due to the physicochemical and biochemical properties of their digestive system soil feeding termites effectively catalyze the transformation of refractory soil organic nitrogen to a plant available form that is protected from leaching by adsorption to the nest soil nitrogen mineralization rates of soil feeding termites may surpass those effected by tropical earthworms and should contribute significantly to nitrogen fluxes in tropical ecosystems
physiological colour change in the elytra of the hercules beetle dynastes hercules ||||| abstract the male of the hercules beetle dynastes hercules is able to change the colour of its elytra from yellowish to black and back again to yellowish within a few minutes the epicuticle of the elytra is transparent and about mm thick below it is a yellow spongy layer that is usually about mm thick the cuticle below the yellow sponge is black when the layer of yellow sponge is air filled it becomes optically heterogeneous and the light reflected from the elytra is yellow when the yellow sponge is liquid filled it becomes optically homogeneous and the black cuticle below is seen if a beetle that has yellowish elytra is placed in a saturated atmosphere the elytra become black when the relative humidity is appreciably reduced yellow patches begin to appear on the elytra usually within sec to min however if the beetle is kept at a constant relative humidity that previously caused yellowing it will become black given enough time most colour changes observed were clearly in response to changes in the ambient humidity and were not affected when the beetles were kept in the light or in total darkness nor by blackening their eyes or prodding them or exposing them to sounds of different intensities or frequencies if an elytron is removed from a live beetle it changes colour in response to changes in relative humidity exactly like the elytron left attached when a restricted area of the elytra is subjected to a humidity that normally causes blackening and an adjacent area to a humidity that normally causes yellowing both change colour in the expected way this local control of colour change seems to preclude hormonal control it is suggested that the epidermal cells or both the epidermal and blood cells in the elytra are responsible for the hydration and dehydration of the layer of yellow sponge
functional dorsoventral symmetry in relation to lift based swimming in the ocean sunfish mola mola ||||| the largest up to tons and a globally distributed teleost the ocean sunfish mola mola is commonly regarded as a planktonic fish because of its unusual shape including absence of caudal fin this common view was recently questioned because the horizontal movements of the ocean sunfish tracked by acoustic telemetry were independent of ocean currents however direct information regarding their locomotor performance under natural conditions is still lacking by using multi sensor tags we show that sunfish indeed swam continuously with frequent vertical movements at speeds of m s which is similar to the records of other large fishes such as salmons marlins and pelagic sharks the acceleration data revealed that they stroked their dorsal and anal fins synchronously dominant frequency hz to generate a lift based thrust as penguins do using two symmetrical flippers morphological studies of sunfish mass kg showed that the dorsal and anal fins had similar external symmetrical shape and identical area and internal identical locomotory muscle mass features however the muscle shape differed markedly we conclude that ocean sunfish have functional dorsoventral symmetry with regards to the non homologous dorsal and anal fins that act as a pair of vertical hydrofoils although sunfish lack a swimbladder we found that they are neutrally buoyant independent of depth because of their subcutaneous gelatinous tissue that has low density and is incompressible efficient lift based swimming in conjunction with neutral buoyancy enables sunfish to travel long distances both horizontally and vertically
a cultured greigite producing magnetotactic bacterium in a novel group of sulfate reducing bacteria ||||| the crystal structure of biomineralized magnetic nanocrystals depends on environmental and genetic factors magnetotactic bacteria contain magnetosomes intracellular membrane bounded magnetic nanocrystals of magnetite fe o or greigite fe s that cause the bacteria to swim along geomagnetic field lines we isolated a greigite producing magnetotactic bacterium from a brackish spring in death valley national park california usa strain bw that is able to biomineralize greigite and magnetite depending on culture conditions a phylogenetic comparison of bw and similar uncultured greigite and or magnetite producing magnetotactic bacteria from freshwater to hypersaline habitats shows that these organisms represent a previously unknown group of sulfate reducing bacteria in the deltaproteobacteria genomic analysis of bw reveals the presence of two different magnetosome gene clusters suggesting that one may be responsible for greigite biomineralization and the other for magnetite
partial purification of tomato fruit peroxidase and its effect on the mechanical properties of tomato fruit skin ||||| peroxidase ec mediated stiffening of cell walls within the fruit skin of tomato is hypothesized to regulate fruit growth however to date there is no experimental evidence demonstrating that peroxidase affects the mechanical properties of skin tissue here the mechanical properties of skin strips excised from a range of fruits at different ages were determined using an instron universal material testing instrument the stiffness of tomato fruit skin strips increases fold with increasing fruit age application of partially purified peroxidase from the cell walls of mature tomato fruit skin significantly increased the stiffness of fruit skin irrespective of the age of fruit furthermore the application of hydrogen peroxide significantly increased the stiffness of skin strips excised from fruit of an age when endogenous peroxidase isozymes associated with the termination of growth are first detected the results support the hypothesis that the tomato fruit skin plays an integral role in the regulation of tomato fruit growth and that changes in its mechanical properties may be mediated by peroxidase as far as is known this is the first demonstration that peroxidases alter the mechanical properties of the plant cell wall
biomimetics of campaniform sensilla measuring strain from the deformation of holes ||||| we present a bio inspired strategy for designing embedded strain sensors in space structures in insects the campaniform sensillum is a hole extending through the cuticle arranged such that its shape changes in response to loads the shape change is rotated through deg by the suspension of a bell shaped cap whose deflection is detected by a cell beneath the cuticle it can be sensitive to displacements of the order of nm the essential morphology a hole formed in a plate of fibrous composite material was modelled by skordos et al who showed that global deformation of the plate which can be flat curved or a tube induces higher local deformation of the hole due to its locally higher compliance further developments reported here show that this approach can be applied to groups of holes relative to their orientation the morphology of the sensillum in insects suggests that greater sensitivity can be achieved by arranging several holes in a regular pattern that if the hole is oval it can be aimed to sense specific strain directions and that either by controlling the shape of the hole or its relationship with other holes it can have a tuned response to dynamic strains we investigate space applications in which novel bio inspired strain sensors could successfully be used
structural fiber reinforcement of keel blubber in harbor porpoise phocoena phocoena ||||| this study investigated the functional morphology of the blubber that forms the caudal keels of the harbor porpoise phocoena phocoena blubber is a pliant biocomposite formed by adipocytes and structural fibers composed of collagen and elastic fibers caudal keels are dorsally and ventrally placed triangular wedges of blubber that define the hydrodynamic profile of the porpoise tailstock mechanical tests on carcasses demonstrate that when keels are bent they strain nonuniformly along their lengths with highest strains just caudal to the dorsal fin and lowest at the insertion of the flukes therefore caudal keels undergo nonuniform longitudinal deformation while maintaining a stable triangular cross sectional shape polarizing and transmitted light microscopy techniques were used to investigate blubber s d fiber architecture along the length of the dorsal keel the triangular cross sectional shape of the keel appears to be maintained by structural fibers oriented to act as tensile stays the construction of the blubber composite is regionally specific structural fiber densities and diameters are higher in the relatively stiff caudal region of the keel than in the more deformable cranial keel region the orientations of structural fibers also change along the length of the keel cranially no fibers are oriented along the long axis whereas a novel population of longitudinally oriented fibers reinforces the keel at the insertion of the flukes thus differences in the distribution and orientation of structural fibers contribute to the regionally specific mechanical properties of the dorsal keel j morphol c wiley liss inc
do macrophytes play a role in constructed treatment wetlands ||||| the larger aquatic plants growing in wetlands are usually called macrophytes these include aquatic vascular plants aquatic mosses and some larger algae the presence or absence of aquatic macrophytes is one of the characteristics used to define wetlands and as such macrophytes are an indispensable component of these ecosystems as the most important removal processes in constructed treatment wetlands are based on physical and microbial processes the role of the macrophytes in these has been questioned this paper summarizes how macrophytes influence the treatment processes in wetlands the most important functions of the macrophytes in relation to the treatment of wastewater are the physical effects the presence of the plants gives rise to the macrophytes stabilise the surface of the beds provide good conditions for physical filtration prevent vertical flow systems from clogging insulate the surface against frost during winter and provide a huge surface area for attached microbial growth contrary to earlier belief the growth of macrophytes does not increase the hydraulic conductivity of the substrate in soil based subsurface flow constructed wetlands the metabolism of the macrophytes affects the treatment processes to different extents depending on the type of the constructed wetland plant uptake of nutrients is only of quantitative importance in low loaded systems surface flow systems macrophyte mediated transfer of oxygen to the rhizosphere by leakage from roots increases aerobic degradation of organic matter and nitrification the macrophytes have additional site specific values by providing habitat for wildlife and making wastewater treatment systems aesthetically pleasing
vortex wake and flight kinematics of a swift in cruising flight in a wind tunnel ||||| summary in this paper we describe the flight characteristics of a swift apus apus in cruising flight at three different flight speeds and m s in a low turbulence wind tunnel the wingbeat kinematics were recorded by high speed filming and the wake of the bird was visualized by digital particle image velocimetry dpiv certain flight characteristics of the swift differ from those of previously studied species as the flight speed increases the angular velocity of the wingbeat remains constant and so as the wingbeat amplitude increases the frequency decreases accordingly as though the flight muscles were contracting at a fixed rate the wings are also comparatively inflexible and are flexed or retracted rather little during the upstroke the upstroke is always aerodynamically active and this is reflected in the wake where shedding of spanwise vorticity occurs throughout the wingbeat although the wake superficially resembles those of other birds in cruising flight with a pair of trailing wingtip vortices connected by spanwise vortices the continuous shedding of first positive vorticity during the downstroke and then negative vorticity during the upstroke suggests a wing whose circulation is gradually increasing and then decreasing during the wingbeat cycle the wake and implied wing aerodynamics are not well described by discrete vortex loop models but a new wake based model where incremental spanwise and streamwise variations of the wake impulse are integrated over the wingbeat shows good agreement of the vertical momentum flux with the required weight support the total drag was also estimated from the wake alone and the calculated lift drag ratio of approximately for flapping flight is the highest measured yet for birds
psammophily in namib desert spiders ||||| abstract a community of psammophilous spiders was studied in the central namib desert of species were cursorial complex setae claws or keels facilitate digging sweeping carrying and swimming in or walking on sand while long spigots enable spiders to bind sand with silk when burrowing down to depths with amenable microclimate cm sand is excavated either by sweeping it up an incline or carrying it vertically up other characteristics of dune spiders were large size polyphagy low metabolism longevity brood care and seasonal foraging and breeding patterns the large dominant heteropodid leucorchestris may determine many characteristics of the namib arthropod community
skeletal development in sloths and the evolution of mammalian vertebral patterning ||||| mammals show a very low level of variation in vertebral count particularly in the neck phenotypes exhibited at various stages during the development of the axial skeleton may play a key role in testing mechanisms recently proposed to explain this conservatism here we provide osteogenetic data that identify developmental criteria with which to recognize cervical vs noncervical vertebrae in mammals except for sloths all mammals show the late ossification of the caudal most centra in the neck after other centra and neural arches in sloths with ribless neck vertebrae the caudal most neck centra ossify early matching the pattern observed in cranial thoracic vertebrae of other mammals accordingly we interpret the ribless neck vertebrae of three toed sloths caudal to v as thoracic based on our developmental criterion applied to the unusual vertebral phenotype of long necked sloths these data support the interpretation that elements of the axial skeleton with origins from distinct mesodermal tissues have repatterned over the course of evolution
plant green island phenotype induced by leaf miners is mediated by bacterial symbionts ||||| the life cycles of many organisms are constrained by the seasonality of resources this is particularly true for leaf mining herbivorous insects that use deciduous leaves to fuel growth and reproduction even beyond leaf fall our results suggest that an intimate association with bacterial endosymbionts might be their way of coping with nutritional constraints to ensure successful development in an otherwise senescent environment we show that the phytophagous leaf mining moth phyllonorycter blancardella lepidoptera relies on bacterial endosymbionts most likely wolbachia to manipulate the physiology of its host plant resulting in the green island phenotype photosynthetically active green patches in otherwise senescent leaves and to increase its fitness curing leaf miners of their symbiotic partner resulted in the absence of green island formation on leaves increased compensatory larval feeding and higher insect mortality our results suggest that bacteria impact green island induction through manipulation of cytokinin levels this is the first time to our knowledge that insect bacterial endosymbionts have been associated with plant physiology
stability in fig tree fig wasp mutualisms how to be a cooperative fig wasp ||||| fig tree fig wasp mutualisms are diverse and underpin much biodiversity the wasps agaonidae are the sole pollinators of the trees ficus figs are enclosed inflorescences each of which contains many small flowers female wasps foundresses enter receptive figs to spread pollen and to lay their eggs individually into fig flowers as they oviposit wasps also inject chemicals that transform individual flower ovaries into galls that will feed and house wasp offspring for fig tree fig wasp mutualisms to persist the trees must set seed therefore the wasps have both to pollinate and to fail to gall all flower ovaries however wasps that avoid pollination costs and or gall all flowers are predicted to outcompete more cooperative conspecifics resulting in destabilisation of the mutualism here i review the literature on why wasps pollinate by focusing on how trees reduce investment to unpollinated figs resulting in sanctions to wasps that fail to pollinate via reduced production of offspring i also review the mechanisms that prevent wasps from galling all flowers mainly those in monoecious ficus that also result in wasps predominantly galling longer flowers whilst leaving shorter flowers to become seeds i make suggestions for future work and conclude by reaffirming why multiple processes promote stability in fig tree fig wasp mutualisms
rain wind and touch induced expression of calmodulin and calmodulin related genes in arabidopsis ||||| in response to water spray subirrigation wind touch wounding or darkness arabidopsis regulates the expression of at least four touch induced tch genes ten to thirty minutes after stimulation mrna levels increase up to fold arabidopsis plants stimulated by touch develop shorter petioles and bolts this developmental response is known as thigmomorphogenesis tch cdna encodes the putative arabidopsis calmodulin differing in one amino acid from wheat calmodulin sequenced regions of tch and tch contain and amino acid identities to calmodulin respectively the regulation of this calmodulin related gene family in arabidopsis suggests that calcium ions and calmodulin are involved in transduction of signals from the environment enabling plants to sense and respond to environmental changes
photosynthetic adaptation of two semi arid species of gethyllis kukumakranka to drought and shade stress ||||| abstract gethyllis multifolia and gethyllis villosa are winter growing summer blooming deciduous and bulbous geophytes that grow naturally in the semi arid succulent karoo biome of south africa g multifolia is threatened in its natural habitat and resides in the vulnerable category of the red data list of southern african plants previous investigations suggested that g multifolia is more sensitive to drought stress than g villosa and that both species adopted certain morphological changes in their leaves during shade stress current models indicate that this biome is being exposed to increasingly drier conditions and shading from encroaching indigenous plant species in this study the photosynthetic gas exchange responses of both species to drought and shade stresses were investigated and the vulnerable conservation status of g multifolia this investigation found that during drought stress g villosa had a more enhanced photosynthetic performance than g multifolia which appears not to be related to foliar adaptations such as specific leaf mass slm but to the g villosa s leaves maintaining their stomatal conductance gs photosynthetic light compensation lcp and photon yields furthermore during shade stress g villosa also had an improved photosynthetic performance by not altering its photosynthetic lcp during reduced light conditions it can be concluded that g multifolia has a lower capacity than g villosa to adapt its photosynthetic apparatus to changing environments such as increasing drought and shaded conditions this may be a contributing factor to the threatened conservation status of g multifolia
fluctuations and redundancy in optimal transport networks ||||| the structure of networks that provide optimal transport properties has been investigated in a variety of contexts while many different formulations of this problem have been considered it is recurrently found that optimal networks are trees it is shown here that this result is contingent on the assumption of a stationary flow through the network when time variations or fluctuations are allowed for a different class of optimal structures is found which share the hierarchical organization of trees yet contain loops the transitions between different network topologies as the parameters of the problem vary are examined these results may have strong implications for the structure and formation of natural networks as is illustrated by the example of leaf venation networks
the geometry of the forisome sieve element sieve plate complex in the phloem of vicia faba l leaflets ||||| forisomes are contractile protein bodies that appear to control flux rates in the phloem of faboid legumes by reversibly plugging the sieve tubes plugging is triggered by ca which induces an anisotropic deformation of forisomes consisting of a longitudinal contraction and a radial expansion by conventional light microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy the three dimensional geometry of the forisome sieve element sieve plate complex in intact sieve tubes of leaflets of vicia faba l was reconstructed forisomes were mostly located close to sieve plates and occasionally were observed drifting unrestrainedly along the sieve element suggesting that they might be utilized as internal markers of flow direction the diameter of forisomes in the resting state correlated with the diameter of their sieve elements supporting the idea that radial expansion of forisomes is the geometric basis of reversible sieve tube plugging comparison of the present results regarding forisome geometry in situ with previously published data on forisome reactivity in vitro makes it questionable however whether forisomes are capable of completely sealing sieve tubes in v faba leaves
secondary metabolites of bagassa guianensis aubl wood a study of the chemotaxonomy of the moraceae family ||||| in order to explain the durability of the moraceae plant family phytochemistry of bagassa guianensis was performed ethyl acetate extract was obtained from the heartwood and secondary metabolites were isolated including moracins o methyl moracin m o methyl moracin n and moracin z previously identified moracin m moracin n and moracin p stilbenoids presently identified epialboctalol and arachidin previously identified alboctalol trans resveratrol arachidin trans oxyresveratrol and artogomezianol previously identified flavonoids steppogenin katuranin and dihydromorin beta sitosterol and resorcinol previous studies suggest that stilbenoids are responsible for the natural durability of wood our study has determined that b guianensis is closely related to morus sp in phylogeny and should be included in the moreae sensu stricto tribe of the moraceae family
a biomechanical perspective on the role of large stem volume and high water content in baobab trees adansonia spp bombacaceae ||||| the stems of large trees serve in transport storage and support however the degree to which these roles are reflected in their morphology is not always apparent the large water filled stems of baobab trees adansonia spp are generally assumed to serve a water storage function yet recent studies indicate limited use of stored water through an analysis of wood structure and composition we examined whether baobab morphology reflects biomechanical constraints rather than water storage capacity in the six madagascar baobab species baobab wood has a high water content up to low wood density g cm high parenchyma content and living cells beyond cm into the xylem from the cambium volumetric construction cost of the wood is several times lower than in more typical trees and the elastic modulus approaches that of parenchyma tissue safety factors calculated from estimated elastic buckling heights were low indicating that baobabs are not more overbuilt than other temperate and tropical trees yet the energy investment in stem material is comparable to that in temperate deciduous trees furthermore the elastic modulus of the wood decreases with water content such that excessive water withdrawal from the stem could affect mechanical stability
interaction of two myosins with microfilaments causes locomotion inlabyrinthula sp ||||| summarycytoskeleton elements of alabyrinthula isolate from the falkland islands were studied the most important characteristic of the genuslabyrinthula is a colourless branched plasmatic network of pseudopodia like tubes with sliding spindle shaped uninuclear plasma portions cell bodies after fluorescent staining tubulin appears to be uniformly and diffusely distributed throughout the whole network and to form a reticulate structure in the cell bodies the inhibitor colchicine has no influence on the sliding motility of the cell bodies nor on the movement of the network actin is frequently found in the network partly in the form of microfilament bundles which are longitudinally arranged actin is also present in the cortical region of cell bodies or of cell body groups it was difficult to distinguish single cell bodies within groups by fluorescence the inhibitors cytochalasin b and d stop the movement of cell bodies and network myosin is present in the cortical region of each cell body and the central portions of each individual cell body contain accumulations of this protein we could not observe any fluorescence in the network after myosin staining with the antibodies we used an actin myosin complex is probably responsible for the sliding movement of cell bodies in the labyrinthula network because actin is found in the pseudopodia like tubes and the cortex of the cell bodies is rich in actin and myosin this actin myosin complex seems to differ from another actin myosin complex that has been postulated to be responsible for the locomotion of pseudopodia like tubes we propose that two actin myosin complexes exist one of them is responsible for locomotory phenomena of the network and the second for cell body sliding in the pseudopodia like tubes in each case the myosin is probably anchored in the inner matrix membrane of the pseudopodia like tubes a model for actin myosin interaction inlabyrinthula spp is presented
sidewinding with minimal slip snake and robot ascent of sandy slopes ||||| limbless organisms such as snakes can navigate nearly all terrain in particular desert dwelling sidewinder rattlesnakes crotalus cerastes operate effectively on inclined granular media such as sand dunes that induce failure in field tested limbless robots through slipping and pitching our laboratory experiments reveal that as granular incline angle increases sidewinder rattlesnakes increase the length of their body in contact with the sand implementing this strategy in a physical robot model of the snake enables the device to ascend sandy slopes close to the angle of maximum slope stability plate drag experiments demonstrate that granular yield stresses decrease with increasing incline angle together these three approaches demonstrate how sidewinding with contact length control mitigates failure on granular media robots based on sidewinder rattlesnakes are used to understand motion on sloped granular terrain also see perspective by socha what s that coming over the hill is it a robot crossing a slope can be difficult particularly if it is made of sand sidewinder rattlesnakes manage to climb sandy hills by adjusting the length of their body in contact with the sand marvi et al designed robots based on this idea to determine what affects climbing ability on sandy slopes see the perspective by socha based on the behavior of the robots the authors performed further animal studies and used an iterative approach to improve the robots capabilities and to better understand animal motion science this issue p see also p
shark skin surfaces for fluid drag reduction in turbulent flow a review ||||| the skin of fast swimming sharks exhibits riblet structures aligned in the direction of flow that are known to reduce skin friction drag in the turbulent flow regime structures have been fabricated for study and application that replicate and improve upon the natural shape of the shark skin riblets providing a maximum drag reduction of nearly per cent mechanisms of fluid drag in turbulent flow and riblet drag reduction theories from experiment and simulation are discussed a review of riblet performance studies is given and optimal riblet geometries are defined a survey of studies experimenting with riblet topped shark scale replicas is also given a method for selecting optimal riblet dimensions based on fluid flow characteristics is detailed and current manufacturing techniques are outlined due to the presence of small amounts of mucus on the skin of a shark it is expected that the localized application of hydrophobic materials will alter the flow field around the riblets in some way beneficial to the goals of increased drag reduction
food and feeding behavior of the black faced spoonbill ||||| abstract feeding black faced spoonbills platalea minor were studied in four main areas along the coasts of south korea taiwan china and vietnam they fed on nekton mainly fish and shrimps varying in length between cm that were caught by sweeping the bill in the water the feeding behavior of a spoonbill is a chain of feeding and inter feeding bouts each feeding bout started by putting the bill into the water and ended when the bill was taken out and any prey captured was swallowed the times between feeding bouts were short and no or few steps were made in a complete feeding bout up to three functional phases were distinguished these were successively the attempt to locate a prey the attempt to catch the located prey the handling and swallowing of the prey a feeding bout could end in any phase a total of feeding bouts were recorded of which ended with swallowing prey the mean outcome was small cm long and large cm long prey per min tentative measurements indicated that a feeding spoonbill walked on average m per s during which time the bill made sweeps with a bill velocity of km h meanwhile testing about of the area within reach of their bill for the presence of food feeding by black faced spoonbills often looked chaotic because they usually walk all over the feeding site at a variable speed while showing a large variety of actions especially when large prey is present however analyses of the observations show that they behave efficiently and reduce time and energy spent in feeding in several ways including giving up times not much longer than the duration of bouts with success pursuing only large prey ceasing feeding and starting to rest or going to another site when no prey is caught in min with their tactile way of feeding on invisible prey they also behaved efficiently by consuming all detected prey that could be caught and swallowed
the mechanics of the flower stem of the sedge carex acutiformis ||||| the mechanics of the triangular stems of carex acutiformis was investigated by subjecting sections to bending and torsional tests the stem was rigid in bending being stiffened peripherally by lignified material around the vascular bundles but because of its triangular shape it was vulnerable to local buckling despite being and narrow the stem was able to support the seed head though it sagged appreciably towards the tip in contrast the stem had very low torsional rigidity both because of its triangular shape because the strands of lignified material were isolated from each other in its lowland habitat this allows the drooping stem to twist away from the light winds so reducing drag and the chances of self fertilization this method of reconfiguring is not possible in the shorter stiffer mountain sedges which must withstand higher winds many therefore have more circular stems which will be more efficient at resisting bending

a spider that feeds indirectly on vertebrate blood by choosing female mosquitoes as prey ||||| spiders do not feed directly on vertebrate blood but a small east african jumping spider salticidae evarcha culicivora feeds indirectly on vertebrate blood by choosing as preferred prey female mosquitoes that have had recent blood meals experiments show that this spider can identify its preferred prey by sight alone and by odor alone when presented with two types of size matched motionless lures e culicivora consistently chose blood fed female mosquitoes in preference to nonmosquito prey male mosquitoes and sugar fed female mosquitoes i e females that had not been feeding on blood when the choice was between mosquitoes of different sizes both blood or both sugar fed small juveniles chose the smaller prey whereas adults and larger juveniles chose the larger prey however preference for blood took precedence over preference for size i e to get a blood meal small individuals took prey that were larger than the preferred size and larger individuals took prey that were smaller than the preferred size when presented with odor from two prey types e culicivora approached the odor from blood fed female mosquitoes significantly more often the odor of the prey that were not carrying blood
animal communication tree hole frogs exploit resonance effects ||||| animal mating calls that exert a comparatively high sound pressure propagate over greater distances and generally have greater attractive power here we show that calling male bornean tree hole frogs metaphrynella sundana actively exploit the acoustic properties of cavities in tree trunks that are partially filled with water and which are primarily used as egg deposition sites by tuning their vocalizations to the resonant frequency of the hole which varies with the amount of water that it contains these frogs enhance their chances of attracting females
acoustics in a fly s ear ||||| organisms often identify the source of a sound by comparing the noises that arrive at the two ears using some interesting tricks a minute fly has mastered this feat as accurately as humans
utilising the synergy between plants and rhizosphere microorganisms to enhance breakdown of organic pollutants in the environment pp ||||| background phytoremediation is a promising technology for the cleanup of polluted environments the technology has so far been used mainly to remove toxic heavy metals from contaminated soil but there is a growing interest in broadening its applications to remove degrade organic pollutants in the environment both plants and soil microorganisms have certain limitations with respect to their individual abilities to remove breakdown organic compounds a synergistic action by both rhizosphere microorganisms that leads to increased availability of hydrophobic compounds and plants that leads to their removal and or degradation may overcome many of the limitations and thus provide a useful basis for enhancing remediation of contaminated environments main features the review of literature presented in this article provides an insight to the nature of plant microbial interactions in the rhizosphere with a focus on those processes that are relevant to the breakdown and or removal of organic pollutants due consideration has been given to identify opportunities for utilising the plant microbial synergy in the rhizosphere to enhance remediation of contaminated environments results and discussion the literature review has highlighted the existence of a synergistic interaction between plants and microbial communities in the rhizosphere this interaction benefits both microorganisms through provision of nutrients by root exudates and plants through enhanced nutrient uptake and reduced toxicity of soil contaminants the ability of the plant microbial interaction to tackle some of the most recalcitrant organic chemicals is of particular interest with regard to enhancing and extending the scope of remediation technologies conclusions plant microbial interactions in the rhizosphere offer very useful means for remediating environments contaminated with recalcitrant organic compounds outlook a better knowledge of plant microbial interactions will provide a basis for improving the efficacy of biological remediations further research is however needed to investigate different feedback mechanisms that select and regulate microbial activity in the rhizosphere
epoxide opening cascades promoted by water ||||| selectivity rules in organic chemistry have been inferred largely from nonaqueous environments in contrast enzymes operate in water and the chemical effect of the medium change remains only partially understood structural characterization of the ladder polyether marine natural products raised a puzzle that persisted for years although the stereochemistry of adjacent tetrahydropyran thp cycles would seem to arise from a biosynthetic cascade of epoxide opening reactions experience in organic solvents argued consistently that such a pathway would be kinetically disfavored we report that neutral water acts as an optimal promoter for the requisite ring opening selectivity once a single templating thp is appended to a chain of epoxides this strategy offers a high yielding route to the naturally occurring ladder core and highlights the likely importance of aqueous medium effects in underpinning certain noteworthy enzymatic selectivities

microbial biosynthesis of alkanes ||||| toward alkane synthesis alkanes are major components of fossil fuels and synthesis of alkanes remains a challenge in the conversion of renewable raw materials to fuels even though diverse organisms synthesize alkanes synthesis pathways have remained elusive now schirmer et al p describe an alkane biosynthesis pathway in cyanobacteria that converts intermediates of fatty acid metabolism to alkanes and alkenes heterologous expression of the biosynthetic genes resulted in production of alkanes in escherichia coli this pathway is likely to be a valuable tool in the production of biofuels alkane biosynthesis genes were identified in cyanobacteria and engineered into escherichia coli for recombinant hydrocarbon production alkanes the major constituents of gasoline diesel and jet fuel are naturally produced by diverse species however the genetics and biochemistry behind this biology have remained elusive here we describe the discovery of an alkane biosynthesis pathway from cyanobacteria the pathway consists of an acyl acyl carrier protein reductase and an aldehyde decarbonylase which together convert intermediates of fatty acid metabolism to alkanes and alkenes the aldehyde decarbonylase is related to the broadly functional nonheme diiron enzymes heterologous expression of the alkane operon in escherichia coli leads to the production and secretion of c to c mixtures of alkanes and alkenes these genes and enzymes can now be leveraged for the simple and direct conversion of renewable raw materials to fungible hydrocarbon fuels
on nonexistence of any l invariand positive harmonic function a counter example to stroock conjecture ||||| consider a sub markovian semigroup such that l the border number between recrrence and transience equals zero in d w stroock conjectured that under general hypotheses on the semi group the corresponding process always admits an invariant measure in this paper we present an example of a second order elliptic operator p with a generalized principal eigenvalue l which equals zero such that the parabolic equation does not admit any positive invariant p harmonic function and also any invariant measure this gives a counter example to stroock s conjecture for diffusion processes we also present an example of a complete riemannian manifold m which does not admit any positive invariant harmonic function while l the bottom of the spectrum of m is zero this gives a partial answer to a question of stroock and sullivan
new insights into the huddling dynamics of emperor penguins ||||| social thermoregulation is a cooperative strategy in which animals actively aggregate to benefit from the warmth of conspecifics in response to low ambient temperatures emperor penguins aptenodytes forsteri use this behaviour to ensure their survival and reproduction during the antarctic winter an emperor penguin colony consists of a dynamic mosaic of compact zones the so called huddles included in a looser network of individuals to maximize energy savings birds should adjust their huddling behaviour according to environmental conditions here we examined the dynamics of emperor penguin aggregations based on photo and video records in relation to climatic factors environmental temperature wind and solar radiation were the main factors contributing to huddle formation the analysis of individual movements showed that birds originating from loose aggregations continually joined huddles sometimes a small number of birds induced a movement that propagated to the entire huddle causing its breakup within min and releasing birds which then integrated into looser aggregations different parts of the colony therefore appeared to continually exchange individuals in response to environmental conditions a likely explanation is that individuals in need of warmth join huddles whereas individuals seeking to dissipate heat break huddles apart the regular growth and decay of huddles operates as pulses through which birds gain conserve or lose heat originally proposed to account for reducing energy expenditure the concept of social thermoregulation appears to cover a highly dynamic phenomenon that fulfils a genuine regulatory function in emperor penguins
cytokeratins mediate epithelial innate defense through their antimicrobial properties ||||| epithelial cells express antimicrobial proteins in response to invading pathogens although little is known regarding epithelial defense mechanisms during healthy conditions here we report that epithelial cytokeratins have innate defense properties because they constitutively produce cytoprotective antimicrobial peptides glycine rich c terminal fragments derived from human cytokeratin a were identified in bactericidal lysate fractions of human corneal epithelial cells structural analysis revealed that these keratin derived antimicrobial peptides kdamps exhibited coil structures with low a helical content synthetic analogs of these kdamps showed rapid bactericidal activity against multiple pathogens and protected epithelial cells against bacterial virulence mechanisms while a scrambled peptide showed no bactericidal activity however the bactericidal activity of a specific kdamp was somewhat reduced by glycine alanine substitutions kdamp activity involved bacterial binding and permeabilization but the activity was unaffected by peptide charge or physiological salt concentration knockdown of cytokeratin a markedly reduced the bactericidal activity of epithelial cell lysates in vitro and increased the susceptibility of murine corneas to bacterial adherence in vivo these data suggest that epithelial cytokeratins function as endogenous antimicrobial peptides in the host defense against infection and that keratin derived antimicrobials may serve as effective therapeutic agents
occurrence of ultraviolet radiation absorbing mycosporine like amino acids in coral mucus and whole corals of french polynesia ||||| specimens of six scleractinian species were gathered during the austral spring october november on the external slope of the barrier reef of arue tahiti and in the lagoon of arutua a tuamotu island mucus of each specimen was collected and the optical density and volume excreted were measured after treatment mucus was analysed for mycosporine like amino acids maas by high performance liquid chromatography hplc nine uv absorbing compounds were present in coral mucus at concentrations between and ng g mucus palythine and mycosporine gly were found in all mucus studied mycosporine glycine was recovered in of specimens and shinorine in porphyra and palythinol were identified as minor maas three recently identified maas palythine serine mycosporine methylamine serine and mycosporine methylamine threonine were also found in mucus from pocillopora within a genus there was a qualitative similarity in maas determined by hplc irrespective of locality values for optical density of the mucus showed the ability of maas to protect the animal host and endosymbiotic algae from uv solar flux and as inferred from the recent literature from oxidative forms of oxygen ho o ho derived from photosynthesis
exploration types of ectomycorrhizae ||||| abstract there is a need to quantify and qualify the ability of ectomycorrhizae to improve tree growth and nutrition and in particular to define criteria to classify ectomycorrhizae with respect to ecologically relevant features whereas the numbers of ectomycorrhizae and morphotypes give useful information when related to root biomass root length or soil volume the development and differentiation of the extramatrical mycelium may represent important predicative features relevant to the ecological classification of ectomycorrhizae here different exploration types of ectomycorrhizae are distinguished based on the amount of emanating hyphae or the presence and differentiation of rhizomorphs their putative ecological importance is discussed
the mechanics of slithering locomotion ||||| in this experimental and theoretical study we investigate the slithering of snakes on flat surfaces previous studies of slithering have rested on the assumption that snakes slither by pushing laterally against rocks and branches in this study we develop a theoretical model for slithering locomotion by observing snake motion kinematics and experimentally measuring the friction coefficients of snakeskin our predictions of body speed show good agreement with observations demonstrating that snake propulsion on flat ground and possibly in general relies critically on the frictional anisotropy of their scales we have also highlighted the importance of weight distribution in lateral undulation previously difficult to visualize and hence assumed uniform the ability to redistribute weight clearly of importance when appendages are airborne in limbed locomotion has a much broader generality as shown by its role in improving limbless locomotion
investigation of microstructure natural frequencies and vibration modes of dragonfly wing ||||| in the present work a thorough investigation on the microstructural and morphological aspects of dragonfly wings was carried out using scanning electron microscope then based on this study and the previous reports a precise three dimensional numerical model was developed and natural frequencies and vibration modes of dragonfly forewing were determined by finite element method the results shown that dragonfly wings are made of a series of adaptive materials which form a very complex composite structure this bio composite fabrication has some unique features and potential benefits furthermore the numerical results show that the first natural frequency of dragonfly wings is about hz and bending is the predominant deformation mode in this stage the accuracy of the present analysis is verified by comparison of calculated results with experimental data this paper may be helpful for micro aerial vehicle design concerning dynamic response
supercontraction forces in spider dragline silk depend on hydration rate ||||| spider dragline silk is a model biological polymer for biomimetic research due to its many desirable and unusual properties supercontraction describes the dramatic shrinking of dragline silk fibers when wetted in restrained silk fibers supercontraction generates substantial stresses of mpa above a critical humidity of approximately relative humidity rh this stress may maintain tension in webs under the weight of rain or dew and could be used in industry for robotics sensor technology and other applications our own findings indicate that supercontraction can generate stress over a much broader range than previously reported from to mpa here we show that this variation in supercontraction stress depends upon the rate at which the environment reaches the critical level of humidity causing supercontraction slow humidity increase over several minutes leads to relatively low supercontraction stress while fast humidity increase over a few seconds typically results in higher supercontraction stress slowly supercontracted fibers take up less water and differ in thermostability from rapidly supercontracted fibers as shown by thermogravimetric analysis this suggests that spider silk achieves different molecular configurations depending upon the speed at which supercontraction occurs ultimately rate dependent supercontraction may provide a mechanism to tailor the properties of silk or biomimetic fibers for various applications
cartilage aggrecan can undergo self adhesion ||||| here it is reported that aggrecan the highly negatively charged macromolecule in the cartilage extracellular matrix undergoes ca mediated self adhesion after static compression even in the presence of strong electrostatic repulsion in physiological like solution conditions aggrecan was chemically end attached onto gold coated planar silicon substrates and gold coated microspherical atomic force microscope probe tips end radius r approximately mum at a density approximately mg ml that simulates physiological conditions in the tissue approximately mg ml colloidal force spectroscopy was employed to measure the adhesion between opposing aggrecan monolayers in nacl m and nacl cacl cl m ca mm aqueous electrolyte solutions aggrecan self adhesion was found to increase with increasing surface equilibration time upon compression s hydrogen bonding and physical entanglements between the chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan side chains are proposed as important factors contributing to aggrecan self adhesion self adhesion was found to significantly increase with decreasing bath ionic strength and hence electrostatic double layer repulsion as well as increasing ca concentration due to the additional ion bridging effects it is hypothesized that aggrecan self adhesion and the macromolecular energy dissipation that results from this self adhesion could be important factors contributing to the self assembled architecture and integrity of the cartilage extracellular matrix in vivo
micronanostructures of the scales on a mosquito s legs and their role in weight support ||||| we show here that the mosquito cannot only give rise to a higher water supporting force than the water strider if the ratio of the water supporting force to the body weight of the insect itself is compared but also can safely take off or land on the water surface and also can attach on any solid surface like the fly we found that the mosquito s legs are covered by numerous scales consisting of the uniform microscale longitudinal ridges nanoscale thickness and microscale spacing between and nanoscale cross ribs nanoscale thickness and spacing between such special delicate microstructure and or nanostructure on the leg surface give a water contact angle of approximately degrees and give a surprising high water supporting ability it was found that the water supporting force of a single leg of the mosquito is about times the body weight of the mosquito compared with a water strider s leg giving a water supporting force of about times the body weight of the insect

current issues in the evolutionary ecology of ant plant symbioses ||||| ant plant symbioses involve plants that provide hollow structures specialized for housing ants and often food to ants in return the inhabiting ants protect plants against herbivores and sometimes provide them with nutrients here we review recent advances in ant plant symbioses focusing on three areas first the nutritional ecology of plant ants which is based not only on plant derived food rewards but also on inputs from other symbiotic partners in particular fungi and possibly bacteria food and protection are the most important currencies exchanged between partners and they drive the nature and evolution of the relationships secondly studies of conflict and cooperation in ant plant symbioses have contributed key insights into the evolution and maintenance of mutualism particularly how partner mediated feedbacks affect the specificity and stability of mutualisms there is little evidence that mutualistic ants or plants are under selection to cheat but the costs and benefits of ant plant interactions do vary with environmental factors making them vulnerable to natural or anthropogenic environmental change thus thirdly ant plant symbioses should be considered good models for investigating the effects of global change on the outcome of mutualistic interactions

does cooperation increase helpers later success as breeders a test of the skills hypothesis in the cooperatively displaying lance tailed manakin ||||| experience improves individual performance in many tasks pre breeding cooperation may provide important experience that improves later success as a breeder offering one compelling explanation for why some individuals delay reproduction to help others breed the skills hypothesis however confounding effects of age quality and alternative selective benefits have complicated rigorous tests of this hypothesis male lance tailed manakins perform cooperative courtship displays involving partnerships between unrelated alpha and beta males and alphas monopolize resulting copulations beta males therefore do not receive immediate direct or indirect fitness benefits but may gain skills during cooperation that increase their later success as an alpha to date however the effect of cooperative experience on later success as a breeder has never been tested in any cooperatively displaying taxon the effects of prior cooperative experience on reproductive success of alpha lance tailed manakins were analysed in a mixed model framework using years of information on cooperative experience and annual and lifetime genetic reproductive success for alpha males models included previously identified effects of age and alpha tenure individual level random effects controlled for quality differences to test for an independent influence of beta experience on success males accumulated up to years of beta experience before becoming alphas but of alphas had no prior beta experience betas became alphas later in life and experienced significantly lower reproductive success in their final year as alpha than males that were never beta but did not have higher lifetime success or longer alpha tenures differences in patterns of annual siring success were best explained by age dependent patterns of reproductive improvement and senescence among alphas not beta experience cooperative experience does not increase relative breeding success for male lance tailed manakins importantly beta cooperation seems to be an alternative reproductive tactic that yields fitness payoffs equivalent to a non cooperative route to alpha status if population growth rate is stable
revisiting synchronous gamete release by fucoid algae in the intertidal zone fertilization success and beyond ||||| in the marine environment both external fertilization and settlement are critical processes linking adult and early juvenile life history phases the success of both processes can be tightly linked in organisms lacking a larval dispersive phase this review focuses on synchronous gamete release spawning in fucoid algae these brown macroalgae are important components of temperate intertidal ecosystems in many parts of the world and achieve synchronous gamete release by integrating various environmental signals photosynthesis dependent sensing of boundary layer inorganic carbon fluxes as well as blue light and green light signals possibly perceived via a chloroplast located photoreceptor s are integrated into pathways that restrict gamete release to periods of low water motion avoidance of turbulent and or high flow conditions in the intertidal zone allows high levels of fertilization success in this group temporal patterns and synchrony of spawning in natural populations are reviewed most species populations have a more or less semilunar periodicity although phase differences occur both between and within species at different geographical locations raising the possibility that tidal and diurnal cues are more important than semilunar cues in entraining the response the ecological and evolutionary role s of synchronous spawning in the intertidal zone are considered particularly with regard to hybridization reproductive isolation in species complexes and reproductive versus recruitment assurance in the intertidal zone where synchronous spawning during calm periods may be important for recruitment assurance in addition to fertilization success ways in which the roles of spawning synchrony could be tested in closely related species with contrasting mating systems outcrossing versus selfing are discussed
giant siliceous spicules from the deep sea glass sponge monorhaphis chuni ||||| only years after realizing during a repair of a telegraph cable pulled out from the deep sea that the depth of the ocean is plentifully populated with a highly diverse fauna and flora the challenger expedition treasured up a rich collection of vitreous sponges hexactinellida they had been described by schulze and represent the phylogenetically oldest class of siliceous sponges phylum porifera they are eye catching because of their distinct body plan which relies on a filigree skeleton it is constructed by an array of morphologically determined elements the spicules soon after during the german deep sea expedition valdivia schulze could describe the largest siliceous hexactinellid sponge on earth the up to m high monorhaphis chuni which develops the equally largest bio silica structure the giant basal spicules mx mm using these spicules as a model basic knowledge on the morphology formation and development of the skeletal elements could be achieved they are formed by a proteinaceous scaffold composed of a kda protein which mediates the formation of the siliceous lamellae into which the proteins are encased the high number of of microm thick lamellae is concentrically arranged around the axial canal the silica matrix is composed of almost pure silicon oxide providing it with unusually optophysical properties which are superior to those of man made waveguides experiments might suggest that the spicules function in vivo as a nonocular photoreception system in addition the spicules have exceptional mechanical properties combining mechanical stability with strength and stiffness like demosponges also the hexactinellids synthesize their silica enzymatically via the enzyme silicatein kda protein it is suggested that these basic insights will surely contribute to a further applied utilization and exploration of silica in bio material biomedical science
correlating nanostructures with function structural colors on the wings of a malaysian bee ||||| structural colours refer to colours generated by nanostructures with the characteristic dimension of the structures on the wavelength of the visible light i e some hundreds of nanometers examples for structural colours are the colours of cds and dvds the colours of soap bubbles or oil films on water thin films or the colours of certain butterfly wings e g photonic crystals recently we located a malaysian bee with iridescent structural coloration on its wings the generation of the colouration is still unknown and there is no respective scientific literature available this study presents the first afm experiments related to the structural coloration of the carpenter bee wing first attempts to investigate the nanostructures of the wing were performed with non contact atomic force microscopy afm park systems xe using a silicon nitride cantilever with a spring constant of n m and a resonance frequency of khz the afm scans reveal three layers with structures with a diamet
dispersal generated sexual selection in a beetle riding pseudoscorpion ||||| summaryafter several generations within a decaying tree ficus spp populations of the pseudoscorpion cordylochernes scorpioides disperse by climbing under the elytra of harlequin beetles acrocinus longimanus eclosing from the tree because the beetles then fly to newly decaying ficus for mating and oviposition they act as effective dispersal agents field experiments and observations indicate that this dispersal mode has been exploited by males who compete to remain on a beetle as a strategic site for inseminating females dispersing on it and on other beetles whereas beetles just eclosed from old trees carried large female biased groups of dispersing pseudoscorpions beetles captured after their maiden flight generally carried a single large male multivariate morphometric analyses indicated that these beetle riding males were much larger than individuals randomly sampled from trees with fighting traits exhibiting the greatest potential for selection highest phoretic differentials in females sexual receptivity was significantly higher at the beginning of dispersal than at the end suggesting that mating occurs on beetles field experiments confirmed that on beetle insemination does take place and that small males are displaced from the subelytral space by larger rivals by contrast laboratory experiments suggest that large male size may not confer high mating success under the low density conditions which characterize populations within trees thus in addition to indicating a novel role for dispersal in the evolution of exaggerated male traits this study suggests that oscillating sexual selection may be important in the maintenance of the extreme phenotypic variation exhibited by males of this species
functional changes with feeding in the gastro intestinal epithelia of the burmese python python molurus ||||| the morphology of the digestive system in fasting and refed burmese pythons was determined as well as the localization of the proton h k atpase and sodium na k atpase pumps in fasting pythons oxyntopeptic cells located within the fundic glands are typically non active with a thick apical tubulovesicular system and numerous zymogen granules they become active immediately after feeding but return to a non active state days after the ingestion of the prey the proton pump expressed throughout the different fasting feeding states is either sequestered in the tubulovesicular system in non active cells or located along the apical digitations extending within the crypt lumen in active cells the sodium pump is rapidly upregulated in fed animals and is classically located along the baso lateral membranes of the gastric oxyntopeptic cells in the intestine it is only expressed along the lateral membranes of the enterocytes i e above the lateral spaces and not along the basal side of the cells thus solute transport within the intestinal lining is mainly achieved through the apical part of the cells and across the lateral spaces while absorbed fat massively crosses the entire height of the cells and flows into the intercellular spaces therefore in the burmese python the gastrointestinal cellular system quickly upregulates after feeding due to inexpensive cellular changes passive mechanisms and the progressive activation and synthesis of key enzymes such as the sodium pump this cell plasticity also allows anticipation of the next fasting and feeding periods
oxygen mass transfer in a model three dimensional artery ||||| arterial geometry is commonly non planar and associated with swirling blood flow in this study we examine the effect of arterial three dimensionality on the distribution of wall shear stress wss and the mass transfer of oxygen from the blood to the vessel wall in a u bend by modelling the blood vessels as either cylindrical or helical conduits the results show that under physiological flow conditions three dimensionality can reduce both the range and extent of low wss regions and substantially increase oxygen flux through the walls the sherwood number and wss distributions between the three dimensional helical model and a human coronary artery show remarkable qualitative agreement implying that coronary arteries may potentially be described with a relatively simple idealized three dimensional model characterized by a small number of well defined geometric parameters the flow pattern downstream of a planar bend results in separation of the sh number and wss effects a finding that implies means of investigating them individually

bug juice harvesting electricity with microorganisms ||||| it is well established that some reduced fermentation products or microbially reduced artificial mediators can abiotically react with electrodes to yield a small electrical current this type of metabolism does not typically result in an efficient conversion of organic compounds to electricity because only some metabolic end products will react with electrodes and the microorganisms only incompletely oxidize their organic fuels a new form of microbial respiration has recently been discovered in which microorganisms conserve energy to support growth by oxidizing organic compounds to carbon dioxide with direct quantitative electron transfer to electrodes these organisms termed electricigens offer the possibility of efficiently converting organic compounds into electricity in self sustaining systems with long term stability

experiences with dormancy in tardigrades ||||| tardigrades often colonise extreme habitats in which they survive using both types of dormancy quiescence and diapause together with nematodes and bdelloid rotifers tardigrades are known to enter quiescence with several forms of cryptobiosis anhydrobiosis cryobiosis anoxybiosis osmobiosis at any stage of their life cycle from egg to adult entering anhydrobiosis tardigrades contract their body into a so called tun loosing most of their free and bound water synthesizing cell protectants e g trehalose glycerol heat shock proteins and strongly reducing or suspending their metabolism our research on cryptobiosis focused on some ecological and evolutionary aspects we evaluated i the long term anhydrobiotic survival by comparing quantitative data on recovery from naturally induced desiccation in several species of tardigrades ii differences in survival patterns between species and populations by experimentally inducing anhydrobiosis and cryobiosis iii phenotypic factors affecting anhydrobiotic survival as regards diapause we considered encystment and eggs encystment involves at least the synthesis of new cuticular structures morphological changes during cyst formation are more complex than those involved in tun formation we analyzed more in detail encystment processes comparing a semiterrestrial with a limnic species several inter specific differences have been identified other than the production of two types of cysts in the semiterrestrial species our analysis of life history traits of a laboratory reared strain of a soil tardigrade revealed a particular hatching phenology that involved the production of both subitaneous and resting eggs the latter need a cue to hatch dehydration followed by re hydration in addition the evolutionary meaning of dormancy in tardigrades is discussed
architecture dependent noise discriminates functionally analogous differentiation circuits ||||| gene regulatory circuits with different architectures patterns of regulatory interactions can generate similar dynamics this raises the question of why a particular circuit architecture is selected to implement a given cellular process to investigate this problem we compared the bacillus subtilis circuit that regulates differentiation into the competence state to an engineered circuit with an alternative architecture synex in silico and in vivo time lapse microscopy measurements showed that synex cells generated competence dynamics similar to native cells and reconstituted the physiology of differentiation however architectural differences between the circuits altered the dynamic distribution of stochastic fluctuations noise during circuit operation this distinction in noise causes functional differences between the circuits by selectively controlling the timing of competence episodes and response of the system to various dna concentrations these results reveal a tradeoff between temporal precision and physiological response range that is controlled by distinct noise characteristics of alternative circuit architectures

huddling behavior in emperor penguins dynamics of huddling ||||| although huddling was shown to be the key by which emperor penguins aptenodytes forsteri save energy and sustain their breeding fast during the antarctic winter the intricacies of this social behavior have been poorly studied we recorded abiotic variables with data loggers glued to the feathers of eight individually marked emperor penguins to investigate their thermoregulatory behavior and to estimate their huddling time budget throughout the breeding season pairing and incubation period contrary to the classic view huddling episodes were discontinuous and of short and variable duration lasting s d h on average despite heterogeneous huddling groups birds had equal access to the warmth of the huddles throughout the breeding season males huddled for s d of their time which raised the ambient temperature that birds were exposed to above degrees c at average external temperatures of degrees c as a consequence of tight huddles ambient temperatures were above degrees c during s d of their huddling time ambient temperatures increased up to degrees c close to birds body temperature this complex social behavior therefore enables all breeders to get a regular and equal access to an environment which allows them to save energy and successfully incubate their eggs during the antarctic winter
bristled shark skin a microgeometry for boundary layer control ||||| there exists evidence that some fast swimming shark species may have the ability to bristle their scales during fast swimming experimental work using a water tunnel facility has been performed to investigate the flow field over and within a bristled shark skin model submerged within a boundary layer to deduce the possible boundary layer control mechanisms being used by these fast swimming sharks fluorescent dye flow visualization provides evidence of the formation of embedded cavity vortices within the scales digital particle image velocimetry dpiv data used to evaluate the cavity vortex formation and boundary layer characteristics close to the surface indicate increased momentum in the slip layer forming above the scales this increase in flow velocity close to the shark s skin is indicative of boundary layer control mechanisms leading to separation control and possibly transition delay for the bristled shark skin microgeometry
the molecular basis of nacre formation ||||| a protein complex guides the process of nacre formation in mollusk shells the mechanisms that determine the structural features of organisms are complex and we are still far from predicting the structure of an organism by looking at its genetic makeup an additional level of complexity exists for organisms that form body parts composed of mineralized structures such as sea shells bone and teeth these organisms must also carefully control the interfaces between the soft body parts and the growing mineral on page in this issue suzuki et al identify two novel proteins pif and pif as key players in controlling the crystal structure of calcium carbonate caco in the pearl forming oyster pinctada fucata the work provides the most complete data set to date for the role of any known protein involved in mollusk biomineralization the methods used in this study may be widely applied in future studies in this field
hyperacute directional hearing in a microscale auditory system ||||| the physics of sound propagation imposes fundamental constraints on sound localization for a given frequency the smaller the receiver the smaller the available cues thus the creation of nanoscale acoustic microphones with directional sensitivity is very difficult the fly ormia ochracea possesses an unusual ear that largely overcomes these physical constraints attempts to exploit principles derived from o ochracea for improved hearing aids are now in progress here we report that o ochracea can behaviourally localize a salient sound source with a precision equal to that of humans despite its small size and minuscule interaural cues the fly localizes sound sources to within deg azimuth as the fly s eardrums are less than mm apart localization cues are around ns directional information is represented in the auditory system by the relative timing of receptor responses in the two ears low jitter phasic receptor responses are pooled to achieve hyperacute timecoding these results demonstrate that nanoscale microscale directional microphones patterned after o ochracea have the potential for highly accurate directional sensitivity independent of their size notably in the fly itself this performance is dependent on a newly discovered set of specific coding strategies employed by the nervous system
how super is supercontraction persistent versus cyclic responses to humidity in spider dragline silk ||||| summary spider dragline silk has enormous potential for the development of biomimetic fibers that combine strength and elasticity in low density polymers these applications necessitate understanding how silk reacts to different environmental conditions for instance spider dragline silk supercontracts in high humidity during supercontraction unrestrained dragline silk contracts up to of its original length and restrained fibers generate substantial stress here we characterize the response of dragline silk to changes in humidity before during and after supercontraction our findings demonstrate that dragline silk exhibits two qualitatively different responses to humidity first silk undergoes a previously unknown cyclic relaxation contraction response to wetting and drying the direction and magnitude of this cyclic response is identical both before and after supercontraction by contrast supercontraction is a permanent tensioning of restrained silk in response to high humidity here water induces stress rather than relaxation and the uptake of water molecules results in a permanent change in molecular composition of the silk as demonstrated by thermogravimetric analysis tga even after drying silk mass increased by after supercontraction by contrast the cyclic response to humidity involves a reversible uptake of water dried post supercontraction silk also differs mechanically from virgin silk post supercontraction silk exhibits reduced stiffness and stress at yield as well as changes in dynamic energy storage and dissipation in addition to advancing understanding supercontraction our findings open up new applications for synthetic silk analogs for example dragline silk emerges as a model for a biomimetic muscle the contraction of which is precisely controlled by humidity alone
structural behavioral and physiological adaptations of bees apoidea for collecting pollen ||||| bees like their wasp relatives forage for and transport food to a nest as provisions for their offspring unlike female sphecoidea which transport arthropods one at a time as prey bees transport pollen requiring specialized scopal brush or corbicular fringed plate structures to transport the dustlike material externally scopae often exhibit further modifications in density and amount of plumosity in relation to the size and ornamentation of the pollen grains they transport bees also differ from sphecid wasps by possessing branched body hairs that are relatively densely packed these hairs the electrostatic surface potential and specialized hair groups for extraction of hidden pollen are important in the acquisition of pollen from flowers structures for grooming brushes combs and scrapers and grooming behavior patterns are modified to permit manipulation and packing of pollen in the specialized transport structures the addition of nectar so that pollen is packed moist is a behavior that permits the carrying of pollen of a great variety of sizes and ornamentations in relatively simplified scopae or in corbiculae the addition of oils to the diet of some bees has resulted in a modified type of scopal structure that has a wooly area basally and stiff guard hairs extending distally and that can transport a mixture of oil and pollen special hairs on the fore and mid basitarsi and teeth of hind tibial spurs are modified as oil scraper and manipulation structures the use of corbiculae in apidae to transport nesting materials and the hind tibiae in male orchid bees euglossini apidae for transporting aromatic compounds involves behavior patterns similar to those for pollen transport in grooming manipulating and packing the materials other behavioral and physiological adaptations important in the location and acquisition of pollen by bees include individual constancy oligolecty seasonal synchrony preimaginal conditioning daily synchrony buzz pollination and other responses to specific modes of pollen presentation most of the behavioral patterns involve learning they may be modified by extrinsic factors and they may modify intrinsic structural and physiological characters
biomechanics of climbing palms and how they climb ||||| climbing plants have fascinated botanists since the pioneering works of darwin and his contemporaries in the th century diverse plants have evolved different ways of climbing and a wide range of attachment devices and stem biomechanics to cope with the particular physical demands of life as a climber we investigated the biomechanics of attachment in a range of climbing palms including true rattans from southeast asia and the genus desmoncus from south america we found that hook strength and orientation is coordinated with rachis geometry and rigidity these findings support the notion of a ratchet type attachment mechanism and partly explain why these spiny plants are so catchy and efficient at attaching to supports
structural coloration in nature ||||| nature s color has three main sources pigments structural colors and bioluminescence structural color is a special one which is the color produced by micro or nano structures and is bright and dazzling the most common mechanisms of structural colors are film interference diffraction grating scattering and photonic crystals biological colors are mainly derived from film interference which includes thin film and multi film interference the diffraction grating mechanism is found in for example seed shrimp mollusk haliotis glabra and the hibiscus trionum flower scattering includes coherent and incoherent scattering well known examples of coherent scattering include colors produced by brilliant iridescent butterfly wing scales and avian feather barbules such as the peacock s tail examples of colors produced by photonic crystal structures include opal in beetles and iridescent spines in the sea mouse coloration changes occur through structural changes for camouflage predation signal communication and sex choice this paper presents an overview of lessons from nature and various relevant mechanisms examples of bioinspired fabrication methods and applications are also presented in this paper
the functional morphology of starfish tube feet the role of a crossed fiber helical array in movement ||||| the morphology and mechanics of the tube feet ampullae and lateral and radial canals of the water vascular systems of luidia clathrata and astropecten articulatus echinodermata asteroidea were analyzed histological methods based on embedding in both paraffin and glycol methacrylate were used to document the arrangement of muscle and connective tissue the tube foot wall includes longitudinal muscles and connective tissue fibers the latter arranged in a crossed fiber helical array with a fiber angle of about deg in elongated tube feet no evidence was found for the circular rings of connective tissue reported in earlier studies the appearance of rings is probably an artifact of folding the ampullae are bilobed and include circumferentially arranged muscle fibers and connective tissue fibers aligned deg to the muscle the lateral canals are short and equipped with oneway flap valves similar to those described for other echinoderms the radial canal is thin walled nonmuscular and enclosed in the connective tissue and ossicles of the ambulacrum frame by frame video analysis of both intact animals and animals with windows cut in the arm wall was used to document the movements of the tube feet and ampullae no evidence was found for the previously suggested role of the radial canal in protracting the tube feet the ampullae protract the tube feet and antagonize the tube foot musculature the fiber angle of the connective tissue allows protraction and prevents dilation of the tube feet and limits elongation of the ampullae
tardigrades use intrinsically disordered proteins to survive desiccation ||||| tardigrades are microscopic animals that survive a remarkable array of stresses including desiccation how tardigrades survive desiccation has remained a mystery for more than years trehalose a disaccharide essential for several organisms to survive drying is detected at low levels or not at all in some tardigrade species indicating that tardigrades possess potentially novel mechanisms for surviving desiccation here we show that tardigrade specific intrinsically disordered proteins tdps are essential for desiccation tolerance tdp genes are constitutively expressed at high levels or induced during desiccation in multiple tardigrade species tdps are required for tardigrade desiccation tolerance and these genes are sufficient to increase desiccation tolerance when expressed in heterologous systems tdps form non crystalline amorphous solids vitrify upon desiccation and this vitrified state mirrors their protective capabilities our study identifies tdps as functional mediators of tardigrade desiccation tolerance expanding our knowledge of the roles and diversity of disordered proteins involved in stress tolerance
suberin a biopolyester forming apoplastic plant interfaces ||||| suberized cell walls form physiologically important plant environment interfaces because they act as barriers that limit water and nutrient transport and protect plants from invasion by pathogens plants respond to environmental stimuli by modifying the degree of suberization in root cell walls salt stress or drought induced suberization leads to a decrease in radial water transport in roots although reinforced suberized cell walls never act as absolutely impermeable barriers deeper insights into the structure and biosynthesis of suberin are required to elucidate what determines the barrier properties progress has been obtained from analytical methods that enabled the structural characterization of oligomeric building blocks in suberin and from the opening of suberin research to molecular genetic approaches by the elucidation of the chemical composition and tissue distribution of suberin in the model species arabidopsis
chemical identity of a rotting animal like odor emitted from the inflorescence of the titan arum amorphophallus titanum ||||| the titan arum amorphophallus titanum is a flowering plant with the largest inflorescence in the world the flower emits a unique rotting animal like odor that attracts insects for pollination to determine the chemical identity of this characteristic odor we performed gas chromatography mass spectrometry olfactometry analysis of volatiles derived from the inflorescence the main odorant causing the smell during the flower opening phase was identified as dimethyl trisulfide a compound with a sulfury odor that has been found to be emitted from some vegetables microorganisms and cancerous wounds
adhesion forces measured at the level of a terminal plate of the fly s seta ||||| the attachment pads of fly legs are covered with setae each ending in small terminal plates coated with secretory fluid a cluster of these terminal plates contacting a substrate surface generates strong attractive forces that hold the insect on smooth surfaces previous research assumed that cohesive forces and molecular adhesion were involved in the fly attachment mechanism the main elements that contribute to the overall attachment force however remained unknown multiple local force volume measurements were performed on individual terminal plates by using atomic force microscopy it was shown that the geometry of a single terminal plate had a higher border and considerably lower centre local adhesion was approximately twice as strong in the centre of the plate as on its border adhesion of fly footprints on a glass surface recorded within min after preparation was similar to adhesion in the centre of a single attachment pad adhesion strongly decreased with decreasing volume of footprint fluid indicating that the layer of pad secretion covering the terminal plates is crucial for the generation of a strong attractive force our data provide the first direct evidence that in addition to van der waals and coulomb forces attractive capillary forces mediated by pad secretion are a critical factor in the fly s attachment mechanism

battle in the amazon arapaima versus piranha ||||| the scales of the arapaimas a large freshwater fish up to kg are a superb example of a natural material that has evolved to provide protection against predators the arapaimas lives primarily in amazon basin lakes that become infested with piranhas as the dry season advances and is covered with scales having up to cm length they have a collagen interior with a highly mineralized external layer the collagen fibers form a cross lamellar arrangement which produces a laminate composite the internal collagenous layer provides the flexibility to the scales which can undergo significant elastic deformation prior to failure providing considerable toughness the mineralized exterior provides the required protection against predation the flexibility of the biomineral is enabled by two factors i a corrugated configuration in which the tensile strains are minimized ii a graded composition we propose herein that the structure of the scales a composite consisting of a mineralized external layer with surface corrugations and an internal flexible collagenous foundation can serve as inspiration for the design of flexible composites having a hard ceramic surface the piranha serrasalminae is one of the principal predators in seasonal lakes in which fish get trapped its teeth form triangular arrays creating a guillotine action that is highly effective in slicing through muscle the bite force is calculated for a piranha with a mass of kg from estimated maximum force values applied by three muscle groups connecting the jaw to the mandible it is n mechanical tests on the scales and teeth demonstrate that the cutting and puncturing ability of the piranha teeth cannot penetrate the arapaimas scales
active site properties of phrixotrix railroad worm green and red bioluminescence eliciting luciferases ||||| the luciferases of the railroad worm phrixotrix coleoptera phengodidae are the only beetle luciferases that naturally produce true red bioluminescence previously we cloned the green pxgr and red emitting pxre luciferases of railroad worms phrixotrix viviani and p hirtus ole these luciferases were expressed and purified and their active site properties were determined the red emitting pxre luciferase displays flash like kinetics whereas pxgr luciferase displays slow type kinetics the substrate affinities and catalytic efficiency of pxre luciferase are also higher than those of pxgr luciferase fluorescence studies with anilino naphthalene sulfonic acid and p toluidino naphthalene sulfonic acid showed that the pxre luciferase luciferin binding site is more polar than that of pxgr luciferase and it is sensitive to guanidine mutagenesis and modelling studies suggest that several invariant residues in the putative luciferin binding site of pxre luciferase cannot interact with excited oxyluciferin these results suggest that one portion of the luciferin binding site of the red emitting luciferase is tighter than that of pxgr luciferase whereas the other portion could be more open and polar
egg attachment of the asparagus beetle crioceris asparagi to the crystalline waxy surface of asparagus officinalis ||||| plant surfaces covered with crystalline epicuticular waxes are known to be anti adhesive hardly wettable and preventing insect attachment but there are insects that are capable of gluing their eggs to these surfaces by means of proteinaceous secretions in this study we analysed the bonding region between the eggs of crioceris asparagi and the plant surface of asparagus officinalis using light and cryo scanning electron microscopy the wettability of the plant surface by egg secretion was compared with that by aqua millipore water aqueous sugar solution and chicken egg white furthermore the force required to remove c asparagi eggs from the plant surface was measured in order to evaluate the egg s bonding strength mean pull off force was mn which is about times higher than the egg weight egg glue was observed spreading over the wax crystal arrays on the plant cladophyll and wetting them similar wetting behaviour on the a officinalis surface was observed for chicken egg white our results support the hypothesis that the mechanism of insect egg adhesion on micro and nanostructured hydrophobic plant surfaces is related to the proteinaceous nature of adhesive secretions of insect eggs the secretion wets superhydrophobic surfaces and after solidifying builds up a composite consisting of the solidified glue and wax crystals at the interface between the egg and plant cuticle
teacher tree the evolution of notch shape optimization from complex to simple ||||| abstract shape optimization of engineering components following the design rules of nature was started in the late eighties in the karlsruhe research centre the key idea was the natural observation that trees care by load adaptive growth to maintain a uniform stress distribution at their surface this means also that high stress peaks notch stresses are avoided as potential failure points the computer simulation of this adaptive growth has been called computer aided optimization cao cao is based on the use of the finite element method fem the present paper shows how years after the cao method drastic simplifications are available so notch shape optimization in many cases can be done without the fem codes with a pocket calculator or even simpler with a graphic method
physiological responses to heat stress in the poorwill ||||| 
distribution of unique red feather pigments in parrots ||||| in many birds red orange and yellow feathers are coloured by carotenoid pigments but parrots are an exception for over a century biochemists have known that parrots use an unusual set of pigments to produce their rainbow of plumage colours but their biochemical identity has remained elusive until recently here we use high performance liquid chromatography to survey the pigments present in the red feathers of species of parrots representing each of the three psittaciform families we found that all species used the same suite of five polyenal lipochromes or psittacofulvins to colour their plumage red indicating that this unique system of pigmentation is remarkably conserved evolutionarily in parrots species with redder feathers had higher concentrations of psittacofulvins in their plumage but neither feather colouration nor historical relatedness predicted the ratios in which the different pigments appeared these polyenes were absent from blood at the time when birds were replacing their colourful feathers suggesting that parrots do not acquire red plumage pigments from the diet but instead manufacture them endogenously at growing feathers
ant search strategies after interrupted tandem runs ||||| summary tandem runs are a form of recruitment in ants during a tandem run a single leader teaches one follower the route to important resources such as sources of food or better nest sites in the present study we investigate what tandem leaders and followers do in the context of nest emigration if their partner goes missing our experiments involved removing either leaders or followers at set points during tandem runs former leaders first stand still and wait for their missing follower but then most often proceed alone to the new nest site by contrast former followers often first engage in a brownian search for almost exactly the time that their former leader should have waited for them and then former followers switch to a superdiffusive search in this way former followers first search their immediate neighbourhood for their lost leader before becoming ever more wide ranging so that in the absence of their former leader they can often find the new nest re encounter the old one or meet a new leader we also show that followers gain useful information even from incomplete tandem runs these observations point to the important principle that sophisticated communication behaviours may have evolved as anytime algorithms i e procedures that are beneficial even if they do not run to completion
induced production of antifungal naphthoquinones in the pitchers of the carnivorous plant nepenthes khasiana ||||| nepenthes spp are carnivorous plants that have developed insect capturing traps evolved by specific modification of the leaf tips and are able to utilize insect degradation products as nutritional precursors a chitin induced antifungal ability based on the production and secretion to the trap liquid of droserone and o methyldroserone is described here such specific secretion uniquely occurred when chitin injection was used as the eliciting agent and probably reflects a certain kind of defence mechanism that has been evolved for protecting the carnivory based provision of nutritional precursors the pitcher liquid containing droserone and o methyldroserone at or molar ratio as well as the purified naphthoquinones exerted an antifungal effect on a wide range of plant and human fungal pathogens when tested against candida and aspergillus spp the concentrations required for achieving inhibitory and fungicidal effects were significantly lower than those causing cytotoxicity in cells of the human embryonic kidney cell line t these naturally secreted naphthoquinone derivatives that are assumed to act via semiquinone enhancement of free radical production may offer a new lead to develop alternative antifungal drugs with reduced selectable pressure for potentially evolved resistance
the acacia ants revisited convergent evolution and biogeographic context in an iconic ant plant mutualism ||||| phylogenetic and biogeographic analyses can enhance our understanding of multispecies interactions by placing the origin and evolution of such interactions in a temporal and geographical context we use a phylogenomic approach ultraconserved element sequence capture to investigate the evolutionary history of an iconic multispecies mutualism neotropical acacia ants pseudomyrmex ferrugineus group and their associated vachellia hostplants in this system the ants receive shelter and food from the host plant and they aggressively defend the plant against herbivores and competing plants we confirm the existence of two separate lineages of obligate acacia ants that convergently occupied vachellia and evolved plant protecting behaviour from timid ancestors inhabiting dead twigs in rainforest the more diverse of the two clades is inferred to have arisen in the late miocene in northern mesoamerica and subsequently expanded its range throughout much of central america the other lineage is estimated to have originated in southern mesoamerica about myr later apparently piggy backing on the pre existing mutualism initiation of the pseudomyrmex vachellia interaction involved a shift in the ants from closed to open habitats into an environment with more intense plant herbivory comparative studies of the two lineages of mutualists should provide insight into the essential features binding this mutualism
thermal windows on the body surface of african elephants loxodonta africana studied by infrared thermography ||||| abstract in this study we examined infrared thermograms in the course of time of six african zoo elephants and observed two phenomena first we noticed independent thermal windows highly vascularised skin areas on the whole elephants body and second we observed distinct and sharply delimited hot sections on the elephants pinnae the frequency of thermal windows increased with increasing ambient temperature and body weight we assume that the restriction of an enhanced cutaneous blood flow to thermal windows might enable the animal to react more flexibly to its needs with regard to heat loss with this understanding the use of thermal windows in heat loss might be seen as a fine tuning mechanism under thermoneutral conditions
toward understanding the cationicity of defensins ||||| human defensins are a family of small antimicrobial proteins found predominantly in leukocytes and epithelial cells that play important roles in the innate and adaptive immune defense against microbial infection the most distinct molecular feature of defensins is cationicity manifested by abundant arg and or lys residues in their sequences sequence analysis indicates that arg is strongly selected over lys in a defensins but not in b defensins to understand this arg lys disparity in defensins we chemically synthesized human a defensin hnp and several hnp analogs where three arg residues were replaced by each of the following six a amino acids lys ornithine orn diaminobutyric acid dab diaminopropionic acid dap n n dimethyl lys dimelys and homo arg homoarg in addition we prepared human b defensin hbd and lys arghbd in which all four lys residues were substituted for arg bactericidal activity assays revealed the following arg containing hnp and lys arghbd are functionally better than lys hnp and hbd respectively the difference between arg and lys is more evident in the a defensin than in the b defensin and is more evident at low salt concentrations than at high salt concentrations for hnp the arg lys disparity is much more pronounced with staphylococcus aureus than with escherichia coli and the arg rich hnp kills bacteria faster than its lys rich analog arg and lys appear to have optimal chain lengths for bacterial killing as shortening lys or lengthening arg in hnp invariably becomes functionally deleterious our findings provide insights into the arg lys disparity in defensins and shed light on the cationicity of defensins with respect to their antimicrobial activity and specificity
the attachment strategy of english ivy a complex mechanism acting on several hierarchical levels ||||| english ivy hedera helix l is able to grow on vertical substrates such as trees rocks and house plaster thereby attaching so firmly to the surface that when removed by force typically whole pieces of the climbing substrate are torn off the structural details of the attachment process are not yet entirely understood we studied the attachment process of english ivy in detail and suggest a four phase process to describe the attachment strategy i initial physical contact ii form closure of the root with the substrate iii chemical adhesion and iv shape changes of the root hairs and form closure with the substrate these four phases and their variations play an important role in the attachment to differently structured surfaces we demonstrate that in english ivy different mechanisms work together to allow the plant s attachment to various climbing substrates and reveal the importance of micro fibril orientation in the root hairs for the attachment based on structural changes at the subcellular level
how archer fish achieve a powerful impact hydrodynamic instability of a pulsed jet in toxotes jaculatrix ||||| archer fish knock down insects anchored to vegetation by hitting them with a precisely aimed jet of water the striking force of the jet at the impact is such to overcome the strong anchoring forces of insects the origin of the effectiveness of such hunting mechanism has been long searched for inside of the fish in the unsuccessful attempt to identify internal structures dedicated to the amplification of muscular power here we perform a kinematic analysis of the jet emitted by two specimens of toxotes jaculatrix we estimate that at the impact the jet conveys a typical specific power of about w kg which is well above the maximum specific power of the order of w kg deliverable by a vertebrate muscle unexpectedly we find that the amplification of muscular power occurs outside of the fish and is due to a hydrodynamic instability of the jet akin to those occurring in drop on demand inkjet printing the investigated fish are found to modulate the velocity of the jet at the orifice to favor the formation of a single large water drop that hits the prey abruptly with a large momentum the observed mechanism represents a remarkable example of use of an external hydrodynamic lever that does possibly not entail the high evolutionary cost needed for the development of highly specialized internal structures dedicated to the storing of mechanical energy
distribution abundances and associations of the endophytic fungal community of arizona fescue festuca arizonica ||||| we documented patterns of species diver sity relative abundances and associations of the fun gal endophyte community inhabiting arizona fescue festuca arizonica a dominant perennial bunchgrass in ponderosa pine grassland communities of the southwestern usa we also determined spatial vari ation in frequency of a vertically transmitted and asexual fungus neotyphodium starrii a dominant en dophyte in arizona fescue to determine if neoty phodium frequency is affected by grazing we com pared frequency of infected grasses inside and out side long term grazing exclosures in four arizona fes cue populations likewise we correlated soil nitrogen levels within and among these four and an additional population to determine if the frequency of neotyphodium infected plants is related to available soil nutrients more than different fungi were isolated from arizona fescue however most of these were extremely rare and isolated only once neoty phodium starrii and other morphospecies com prised the majority of fungal taxa these results sug gest that the fungal endophyte communities of pe rennial grasses may be as diverse as fungal endophyte communities of woody shrubs and trees despite high infection levels of the asexual and vertically transmit ted neotyphodium the diversity and dominance of non neotyphodium endophytes were highly variable among arizona fescue populations and varied season ally and yearly within and among populations most of these fungal species are probably opportunistic colonizers that increase in abundance in late summer with seasonal rains that promote spore transmission and germination and hyphal growth neotyphodium starrii also varied spatially within and among arizona fescue populations although always occurring at higher levels than other endophytic fungi however neotyphodium frequencies were not greater outside grazing exclosures as expected if the endophyte con fers increased resistance to vertebrate herbivores
structural strengthening of urchin skeletons by collagenous sutural ligaments ||||| sea urchin skeletons are strengthened by flexible collagenous ligaments that bind together rigid calcite plates at sutures whole skeletons without ligaments removed by bleaching broke at lower apically applied forces than did intact fresh skeletons in addition in three point bending tests on excised plate combinations sutural ligaments strengthened sutures but not plates the degree of sutural strengthening by ligaments depended on sutural position in tensile tests ambital and adapical sutures were strengthened more than adoral sutures adapical sutures which grow fastest were also the loosest suggesting that strengthening by ligaments is associated with growth in fed growing urchins sutures overall were looser than in unfed urchins looseness was demonstrated visually and by vibration analysis bleached skeletons of unfed urchins rang at characteristic frequencies indicating that sound traveled across tightly fitting sutures skeletons of fed urchins damped vibrations indicating loss of vibrational energy across looser sutures furthermore bleached skeletons of fed urchins broke at lower apically applied forces than bleached skeletons of unfed urchins indicating that the sutures of fed urchins had been held together relatively loosely by sutural ligaments thus the apparently rigid dome like skeleton of urchins sometimes transforms into a flexible jointed membrane as sutures loosen and become flexible during growth
mechanisms of phagocytosis in macrophages ||||| phagocytosis of pathogens by macrophages initiates the innate immune response which in turn orchestrates the adaptive response in order to discriminate between infectious agents and self macrophages have evolved a restricted number of phagocytic receptors like the mannose receptor that recognize conserved motifs on pathogens pathogens are also phagocytosed by complement receptors after relatively nonspecific opsonization with complement and by fc receptors after specific opsonization with antibodies all these receptors induce rearrangements in the actin cytoskeleton that lead to the internalization of the particle however important differences in the molecular mechanisms underlying phagocytosis by different receptors are now being appreciated these include differences in the cytoskeletal elements that mediate ingestion differences in vacuole maturation and differences in inflammatory responses infectious agents such as m tuberculosis legionella pneumophila and salmonella typhimurium enter macrophages via heterogeneous pathways and modify vacuolar maturation in a manner that favors their survival macrophages also play an important role in the recognition and clearance of apoptotic cells a notable feature of this process is the absence of an inflammatory response
shell growth and chamber formation of aquarium reared nautilus pompilius mollusca cephalopoda by x ray analysis ||||| observations on the growth rate of aquarium maintained nautilus pompilius in different developmental stages i e juveniles shell length about cm late juveniles approximately cm and early adolescent approximately cm indicate that this species is fully grown at an age of years the age calculations are based on two different computations the measurement of the increase of the shell length per day and the formation of new septa in time intervals of days as demonstrated by x ray analyses after n pompilius hatches its shell grows about mm to reach full growth and approximately septa are formed with an increase of the shell length of mm per day it takes about days years to reach maturity provided that the process of chamber formation follows an exponential function these computations result in approximately days years to reach full maturity supposing that n pompilius may live for several years after onset of maturity like nautilus belauensis the total life span for this species may exceed years
di myo inositol phosphate and novel udp sugars accumulate in the extreme hyperthermophile pyrolobus fumarii ||||| the archaeon pyrolobus fumarii one of the most extreme members of hyperthermophiles known thus far is able to grow at temperatures up to degc over a decade after the description of this organism our knowledge about the structures and strategies underlying its remarkable thermal resistance remains incipient the accumulation of a restricted number of charged organic solutes is a common response to heat stress in hyperthermophilic organisms and accordingly their role in thermoprotection has been often postulated in this work the organic solute pool of p fumarii was characterized using h c and p nmr di myo inositol phosphate was the major solute mmol mg protein reinforcing the correlation between the occurrence of this solute and hyperthermophily in addition udp sugars total concentration mmol mg protein were present the structures of the two major udp sugars were identified as udp a glcnac nac and udp a glcnac nac b glcpnac nac interestingly the latter compound appears to be derived from the first one by addition of a n acetylglucoronic acid unit suggesting that these udp sugars are intermediates of an n linked glycosylation pathway to our knowledge the udp disaccharide has not been reported elsewhere the physiological roles of these organic solutes are discussed
mutual feedbacks maintain both genetic and species diversity in a plant community ||||| the forces that maintain genetic diversity among individuals and diversity among species are usually studied separately nevertheless diversity at one of these levels may depend on the diversity at the other we have combined observations of natural populations quantitative genetics and field experiments to show that genetic variation in the concentration of an allelopathic secondary compound in brassica nigra is necessary for the coexistence of b nigra and its competitor species in addition the diversity of competing species was required for the maintenance of genetic variation in the trait within b nigra thus conservation of species diversity may also necessitate maintenance of the processes that sustain the genetic diversity of each individual species
osmotic adjustment and plant adaptation to environmental changes related to drought and salinity ||||| the salinization and water deficit of soil are widespread environmental problems in limiting plant survival growth and productivity however some plants could adopt some strategies to resist salinity and drought stresses among these strategies the mechanism of osmotic adjustment could help plants and algae to avoid ion toxicity and maintain water uptake in both stresses by accumulating large quantities of osmolytes two types of osmolytes organic solutes and inorganic ions play a key role in osmotic adjustment different osmolytes and their osmotic adjustment actions are different according to their distribution in different plants organic solutes known as compatible solutes include amino acids glycerol sugars and other low molecular weight metabolites serve a function in cells to lower or balance the osmotic potential of intracellular and extracellular ions in resistance to osmotic stresses inorganic ions for osmotic adjustment are mainly na k ca and cl inorganic ions make great c
bile acid secreted by male sea lamprey that acts as a sex pheromone ||||| we show that reproductively mature male sea lampreys release a bile acid that acts as a potent sex pheromone inducing preference and searching behavior in ovulated female lampreys the secreted bile acid a a trihydroxy a cholan one sulfate was released in much higher amounts relative to known vertebrate steroid pheromones and may be secreted through the gills hence the male of this fish species signals both its reproductive status and location to females by secreting a pheromone that can act over long distances

a passionate free climber structural development and functional morphology of the adhesive tendrils in passiflora discophora ||||| premise of research passiflora discophora is exceptional among passion flowers for its climbing strategy using branched tendrils with terminal adhesive pads instead of coiling tendrils as typical within this family this article investigates the structural development and morphology of these adhesive pads and aims to understand the underlying structure function relationship of the attachment process based on our results we discuss possible mechanical consequences of the tendril structure and compare our findings with similar attachment systems in unrelated species in order to identify general strategies of this mode of attachment methodology we investigated the temporal development of the attachment process including detailed studies of the morphology and anatomy of the adhesive pads using lm with different staining procedures and sem pivotal results young tendrils establish initial contact with a supporting substrate by interlocking with their hook shaped tips touch stimuli induce the tips to develop into adhesive pads by callus like growth of papillate epidermal cells fully grown pads are hemispherical on flat substrates or completely fill out larger cavities of the substrate by apical cell division the pad tissue perfectly mimics the microtopography of the substrate and also grows into minute gaps and fissures establishing firm anchorage by optimal form closure additionally an extracellular substance is visible at the interface between pad and substrate surface which might act as adhesive conclusions the opportunistic growth and cellular structure make the tendrils and adhesive pads of p discophora a highly adaptive attachment system comparison with other not closely related taxa reveals general principles of this climbing mode namely branched tendrils with multiple adhesive pads papillate cells establishing optimal form closure with the substrate and in some species additionally secreting adhesive substances free coiling of axes and persisting anchorage after senescence
floral volatiles controlling ant behaviour ||||| p ants show complex interactions with plants both facultative and mutualistic ranging from grazers through seed predators and dispersers to herders of some herbivores and guards against others but ants are rarely pollinators and their visits to flowers may be detrimental to plant fitness plants therefore have various strategies to control ant distributions and restrict them to foliage rather than flowers these filters may involve physical barriers on or around flowers or decoys and bribes sited on the foliage usually extrafloral nectaries efns alternatively volatile organic compounds vocs are used as signals to control ant behaviour attracting ants to leaves and or deterring them from functional flowers some of the past evidence that flowers repel ants by vocs has been equivocal and we describe the shortcomings of some experimental approaches which involve behavioural tests in artificial conditions we review our previous study of myrmecophytic acacias which used in situ experiments to show that volatiles derived from pollen can specifically and transiently deter ants during dehiscence the effects being stronger in ant guarded species and more effective on resident ants both in african and neotropical species in these plants repellence involves at least some volatiles that are known components of ant alarm pheromones but are not repellent to beneficial bee visitors we also present new evidence of ant repellence by vocs in temperate flowers which is usually pollen based and active on common european ants we use these data to indicate that across a wide range of plants there is an apparent trade off in ant controlling filter strategies between the use of defensive floral volatiles and the alternatives of decoying efns or physical barriers

nesting biology of the mangrove mud nesting ant polyrhachis sokolova forel hymenoptera formicidae in northern australia ||||| summary the nest sites of the mud nesting ant polyrhachis sokolova were studied in darwin harbour mangroves they were found from the ceriops tagal zone to the rhizophora stylosa zone at elevations ranging from to meters above the lowest astronomical tide lat which means that the nests were inundated in of all high tides and for durations of up to hours the nest structure was studied by excavating nests and making a cast of the galleries using polyurethane foam the nests were quite extensive normally with two elevated nest entrances and galleries down to depths of cm the loose soil particles at the nest entrances collapsed when the tide reached them and formed a stopper which prevented water from intruding into the nest in this way the galleries remained dry during high tide the ants showed a clear swimming or walking on the surface behaviour when they returned to the nest just before the entrance collapsed and during ebb the tolerance of the ants to submergence was tested in the laboratory with mortality after hours submergence in seawater at degc and only hours in water at degc therefore the nesting behaviour with trapped air in the galleries is necessary for survival in these environments
epithelial sodium channel enac family phylogeny structure function tissue distribution and associated inherited diseases ||||| the epithelial sodium channel enac is composed of three homologous subunits and allows the flow of na ions across high resistance epithelia maintaining body salt and water homeostasis enac dependent reabsorption of na in the kidney tubules regulates extracellular fluid ecf volume and blood pressure by modulating osmolarity in multi ciliated cells enac is located in cilia and plays an essential role in the regulation of epithelial surface liquid volume necessary for cilial transport of mucus and gametes in the respiratory and reproductive tracts respectively the subunits that form enac named as alpha beta gamma and delta encoded by genes scnn a scnn b scnn g and scnn d are members of the enac degenerin superfamily the earliest appearance of enac orthologs is in the genomes of the most ancient vertebrate taxon cyclostomata jawless vertebrates including lampreys followed by earliest representatives of gnathostomata jawed vertebrates including cartilaginous sharks among euteleostomi bony vertebrates actinopterygii ray finned fishes branch has lost enac genes yet most animals in the sarcopterygii lobe finned fish branch including tetrapoda amphibians and amniotes lizards crocodiles birds and mammals have four enac paralogs we compared the sequences of enac orthologs from species and established criteria for the identification of enac orthologs and paralogs and their distinction from other members of the enac degenerin superfamily especially asic family differences between enacs and asics are summarized in view of their physiological functions and tissue distributions structural motifs that are conserved throughout vertebrate enacs are highlighted we also present a comparative overview of the genotype phenotype relationships in inherited diseases associated with enac mutations including multisystem pseudohypoaldosteronism pha b liddle syndrome cystic fibrosis like disease and essential hypertension
foldable structures and the natural design of pollen grains ||||| upon release from the anther pollen grains of angiosperm flowers are exposed to a dry environment and dehydrate to survive this process pollen grains possess a variety of physiological and structural adaptations perhaps the most striking of these adaptations is the ability of the pollen wall to fold onto itself to prevent further desiccation roger p wodehouse coined the term harmomegathy for this folding process in recognition of the critical role it plays in the survival of the pollen grain there is still however no quantitative theory that explains how the structure of the pollen wall contributes to harmomegathy here we demonstrate that simple geometrical and mechanical principles explain how wall structure guides pollen grains toward distinct folding pathways we found that the presence of axially elongated apertures of high compliance is critical for achieving a predictable and reversible folding pattern moreover the intricate sculpturing of the wall assists pollen closure by preventing mirror buckling of the surface these results constitute quantitative structure function relationships for pollen harmomegathy and provide a framework to elucidate the functional significance of the very diverse pollen morphologies observed in angiosperms
function of the dufour s gland in solitary and social hymenoptera ||||| the poison gland and dufour s gland are the two glands associated with the sting apparatus in female apocrita hymenoptera while the poison gland usually functions as an integral part of the venom delivery system the dufour s gland has been found to differ in its function in various hymenopteran groups like all exocrine glands the function of the dufour s gland is to secrete chemicals but the nature and function of the secretions varies in different taxa functions of the dufour s gland secretions range from serving as a component of material used in nest building larval food and pheromones involved in communicative functions that are important for both solitary and social species this review summarizes the different functions reported for the dufour s gland in hymenopterans illustrating how the dufour s gland secretions can be adapted to give rise to various functions in response to different challenges posed by the ways of life followed by different taxa aspects of development structure chemistry and the evolution of different functions are also touched upon briefly
underwater attachment using hairs the functioning of spatula and sucker setae from male diving beetles ||||| males of dytiscinae beetles use specialized adhesive setae to adhere to female elytra during underwater courtship this coevolution of male setae and female elytra has attracted much attention since darwin however there has been little examination of their biomechanical functioning despite increasing knowledge on biofibrillar adhesion here we report and compare for the first time the mechanisms of underwater attachment using two hair types the primitive spatula and derived passive sucker found in male diving beetles results from interspecific scaling of protarsal palettes and adhesion by single seta suggest better performance in the later evolved circular sucker setae spatula setae with a modified shallow sucker and channels use the combined mechanisms of suction and viscous resistance for adhesion velocity dependent adhesion provides sufficient control for resisting the female s erratic movements while also detaching easily through slow peeling direction dependent shear resistance helps reorient setae surfaces into a preferred direction for effective adhesion seta deformation using different mechanisms for circular and spatula setae reduces the force that is transmitted to the contact interface a softer spring in spatula setae explains their adhesion at lower preloads and assists in complete substrate contact attachment mechanisms revealed in adhesive setae with modified spatula and passive suckers provide insights for bioinspired designs of underwater attachment devices
lymphatic collecting vessel maturation and valve morphogenesis ||||| the lymphatic vasculature plays an essential role in the maintenance of tissue interstitial fluid balance and in the immune response after capture of fluids proteins and antigens by lymphatic capillaries lymphatic collecting vessels ensure lymph transport an important component to avoid lymph backflow and to allow a unidirectional flow is the presence of intraluminal valves defects in the function of collecting vessels lead to lymphedema several important factors and signaling pathways involved in lymphatic collecting vessel maturation and valve morphogenesis have now been discovered the present review summarizes the current knowledge about the key steps of lymphatic collecting vessel development and maturation and focuses on the regulatory mechanisms involved in lymphatic valve formation
discovering the flight autostabilizer of fruit flies by inducing aerial stumbles ||||| just as the wright brothers implemented controls to achieve stable airplane flight flying insects have evolved behavioral strategies that ensure recovery from flight disturbances pioneering studies performed on tethered and dissected insects demonstrate that the sensory neurological and musculoskeletal systems play important roles in flight control such studies however cannot produce an integrative model of insect flight stability because they do not incorporate the interaction of these systems with free flight aerodynamics we directly investigate control and stability through the application of torque impulses to freely flying fruit flies drosophila melanogaster and measurement of their behavioral response high speed video and a new motion tracking method capture the aerial stumble and we discover that flies respond to gentle disturbances by accurately returning to their original orientation these insects take advantage of a stabilizing aerodynamic influence and active torque generation to recover their heading to within deg in ms to explain this recovery behavior we form a feedback control model that includes the fly s ability to sense body rotations process this information and actuate the wing motions that generate corrective aerodynamic torque thus like early man made aircraft and modern fighter jets the fruit fly employs an automatic stabilization scheme that reacts to short time scale disturbances
parasites and mutualism function measuring enemy free space in a fig pollinator symbiosis ||||| mutualisms involve cooperation between species and underpin several ecosystem functions however there is also conflict between mutualists because their interests are not perfectly aligned in addition most mutualisms are exploited by parasites here we study the interplay between cooperation conflict and parasitism in the mutualism between fig trees and their pollinator wasps conflict occurs because each fig ovary can nurture either one seed or one pollinator offspring and while fig trees benefit directly from seeds and pollinator offspring pollen vectors pollinators only benefit directly from pollinator offspring the mechanism s of conflict resolution is debated but must explain the widespread observation that pollinators develop in inner and seeds in outer layers of fig flowers we recently suggested a role for non pollinating figs wasps npfws that are natural enemies or competitors of the pollinators and lay their eggs through the fig wall most npfw offspring develop in outer and middle layer flowers suggesting that inner flowers provide enemy free space for pollinator offspring here we test the hypothesis that npfws cannot reach inner flowers by measuring wasp and fig morphology at the species specific times of npfw attack in the field we found that three species of sycoscapter and philotrypesis wasps that parasitise pollinators could reach and of fig ovaries respectively meanwhile eukobelea and pseudidarnes gall formers despite having shorter ovipositors can access almost all fig flowers and because they attack smaller younger fig fruits our mechanistic results from ovipositing wasps support spatial patterns of wasp offspring segregation within figs to suggest that inner ovules provide enemy free space for pollinators this may contribute to mutualism stability by helping select for pollinators to avoid laying eggs where they are likely to be parasitised these outer flowers then remain free to develop as seeds promoting mutualism persistence
skin structure and wiping behavior of phyllomedusine frogs ||||| four species of the genus phyllomedusa sauvagei iherengi pailona and hypochondrialis were found to have previously undescribed integumental alveolar glands which contain lipid material no lipid glands were observed in agalychnis annae and very few in pachymedusa dacnicolor two other members of the subfamily phyllomedusinae the four species of phyllomedusa demonstrate a complex and stereotyped wiping of the body surface immediately after the secretion of lipid these frogs demonstrate very low evaporative water loss through the skin the low water loss is associated with a constellation of behavioral and physiological characters the selection of a permanent perch where the frogs remain during the day the secretion of lipid by skin glands wiping behavior and the assumption of torpor light and electron microscopy of the integument of these frogs demonstrated a typical anuran skin with the exception of the presence of lipid glands the impermeability of the skin is attributed to the formation of a lipid layer on the skin surface
evidence for trans generational medication in nature ||||| parasites pose a serious threat to host fitness and natural selection should favour host traits that reduce infection or disease symptoms here we provide the first evidence of trans generational medication in which animals actively use medicine to mitigate disease in their offspring we studied monarch butterflies and their virulent protozoan parasites and found that neither caterpillars nor adult butterflies could cure themselves of disease instead adult butterflies preferentially laid their eggs on toxic plants that reduced parasite growth and disease in their offspring caterpillars it has often been suggested that sick animals may use medication to cure themselves of disease but evidence for the use of medication in nature has so far been scarce our results provide evidence that infected animals may indeed use medicine as a defence against parasites and that such medication may target an individual s offspring rather than the individual itself
the biology and ecology of the ocean sunfish mola mola a review of current knowledge and future research perspectives ||||| relatively little is known about the biology and ecology of the world s largest heaviest bony fish the ocean sunfish mola mola despite its worldwide occurrence in temperate and tropical seas studies are now emerging that require many common perceptions about sunfish behaviour and ecology to be re examined indeed the long held view that ocean sunfish are an inactive passively drifting species seems to be entirely misplaced technological advances in marine telemetry are revealing distinct behavioural patterns and protracted seasonal movements extensive forays by ocean sunfish into the deep ocean have been documented and broad scale surveys together with molecular and laboratory based techniques are addressing the connectivity and trophic role of these animals these emerging molecular and movement studies suggest that local distinct populations may be prone to depletion through bycatch in commercial fisheries rising interest in ocean sunfish highlighted by the increase in recent publications warrants a thorough review of the biology and ecology of this species here we review the taxonomy morphology geography diet locomotion vision movements foraging ecology reproduction and species interactions of m mola we present a summary of current conservation issues and suggest methods for addressing fundamental gaps in our knowledge
no shot in the dark myxozoans chemically detect fresh fish ||||| this work reports the discovery of an hitherto unknown chemical recognition trait enabling a parasitic life cycle in aquatic habitats we believe this is the first record of a natural host derived chemical molecule identified as a recognition cue for the phylum myxozoa the actinospores of these parasites attach to fish hosts via polar filaments that are extruded upon mechanical stimulation after preceding recognition of a chemical trigger contained in surface mucus our goal was to identify this signal we separated compounds from a purified active fraction derived from trout mucus by a novel hplc method by subsequent nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of distinct components and testing in bioassays we elicited stimulation of polar filament discharge and sporoplasm emission in actinospores of three myxozoan spp myxobolus cerebralis myxobolus pseudodispar and henneguya nuesslini by the free nucleosides inosine deoxyinosine and guanosine these nucleosides also activated sporoplasm emission nucleosides appear to be appropriate cues for rapid host recognition by the waterborne parasite stages since they are continuously released into surface mucus the recognition mechanism is not specific for susceptible host species at least in the myxozoan spp examined in addition a novel function of nucleobase derivatives as semiochemicals was uncovered and a wider impact of this molecule class in parasite recognition systems and aquatic chemical ecology is predicted the relevance for disease prevention and cell culturing remains to be explored
momilactone sensitive proteins in arabidopsis thaliana ||||| the labdane related diterpenoid momilactone b has potent growth inhibitory activity and was demonstrated to play a particularly critical role in the allelopathy of rice oryza sativa l however there is limited information available about the mode of action of momilactone b on the growth inhibition the present research describes the effects of momilactone b on protein expression in the early development of arabidopsis thaliana seedling which was determined by two dimensional electrophoresis and maldi tofms momilactone b inhibited the accumulation of subtilisin like serine protease amyrin synthase lup b glucosidase and malate synthase at h after the momilactone application those proteins are involved in the metabolic turnover and the production of intermediates needed for cell structures resulting in plant growth and development momilactone b also inhibited the breakdown of cruciferin which is essential for seed germination and seedling growth to construct cell structures momilactone b induced the accumulation of translationally controlled tumor protein glutathione s transferase and cysteine peroxiredoxin these proteins are involved in stress responses and increased stress tolerance in addition glutathione s transferase has the activity of herbicide detoxification and cysteine peroxiredoxin has inhibitory activity for seed germination under unfavorable conditions the present research suggests that momilactone b may inhibit the seedling growth by the inhibition of the metabolic turnover and the production of intermediates for cell structures in addition momilactone induced proteins associated with plant defense responses
the characterization replication and testing of dermal denticles of scyliorhinus canicula for physical mechanisms of biofouling prevention ||||| there is a current need to develop novel non toxic antifouling materials the mechanisms utilized by marine organisms to prevent fouling of external surfaces are of interest in this regard biomimicry of these mechanisms and the ability to transfer the antifouling characteristics of these surfaces to artificial surfaces are a highly attractive prospect to those developing antifouling technologies in order to achieve this the mechanisms responsible for any antifouling ability must be elucidated from the study of the natural organism and the critical surface parameters responsible for fouling reduction dermal denticles of members of the shark family have been speculated to possess some natural as yet unidentified antifouling mechanism related to the physical presence of denticles in this study the dermal denticles of one particular member of the slow swimming sharks scyliorhinus canicula were characterized and it was found that a significant natural variation in denticle dimensions exists in this species the degree of denticle surface contamination was quantified on denticles at various locations and it was determined that the degree of contamination of the dorsal surface of denticles varies with the position on the shark body in addition we successfully produced synthetic sharkskin samples using the real skin as a template testing of the produced synthetic skin in field conditions resulted in significant differences in material attachment on surfaces exhibiting denticles of different dimensions
a biological sub micron thickness optical broadband reflector characterized using both light and microwaves ||||| broadband optical reflectors generally function through coherent scattering from systems comprising one of three designs overlapped chirped or chaotic multilayer reflectors for each the requirement to scatter a broad band of wavelengths is met through the presence of a variation in nanostructural periodicity running perpendicular to the systems outer surfaces consequently the requisite total thickness of the multilayer can often be in excess of mm here we report the discovery and the microwave assisted characterization of a natural system that achieves excellent optical broadband reflectivity but that is less than mm thick this system found on the wing scales of the butterfly argyrophorus argenteus comprises a distinctive variation in periodicity that runs parallel to the reflecting surface rather than perpendicular to it in this way the requirement for an extensively thick system is removed
reversed deep sea carbonate ion basin gradient during paleocene eocene thermal maximum ||||| the paleocene eocene thermal maximum petm ma ago was marked by widespread caco dissolution in deep sea sediments a process that has been attributed to massive release of carbon into the ocean atmosphere system the pattern of carbonate dissolution is key to reconstructing changes in deep sea carbonate chemistry and ultimately the rate magnitude and location of carbon input here we show that during the petm the deep sea undersaturation was not homogeneous among the different ocean basins application of a sediment model to a suite of data records from different sites and ocean basins shows that a globally uniform decrease in deep sea carbonate ion concentration co is inconsistent with the data rather we demonstrate that deep sea co increased from the atlantic through the southern ocean into the pacific our results show that the petm deep sea co basin gradient during dissolution was reversed relative to the modern
lobster sniffing antennule design and hydrodynamic filtering of information in an odor plume ||||| the first step in processing olfactory information before neural filtering is the physical capture of odor molecules from the surrounding fluid many animals capture odors from turbulent water currents or wind using antennae that bear chemosensory hairs we used planar laser induced fluorescence to reveal how lobster olfactory antennules hydrodynamically alter the spatiotemporal patterns of concentration in turbulent odor plumes as antennules flick water penetrates their chemosensory hair array during the fast downstroke carrying fine scale patterns of concentration into the receptor area this spatial pattern blurred by flow along the antennule during the downstroke is retained during the slower return stroke and is not shed until the next flick
antifreeze activity of antarctic fish glycoprotein and a synthetic polymer ||||| antifreeze glycoproteins afgps and proteins isolated from the sera of some polar fish species and overwintering insects are able to depress the freezing temperature of the aqueous body fluids and of water by means of a non col ligative mechanism all previous measurements of the antifreeze effect have been performed on bulk samples under conditions where ice nucleation would be catalysed by participate impurities giving limited and indeterminate degrees of undercooling we report the first measurements of homogeneous spontaneous ice nucleation rates in deeply under cooled k solutions of afgp and polyvinyl pyrrolidone pvp a well characterized polymer which finds use as a cryoprotectant antifreeze activity is said to derive from the sorption of afgp molecules on the active growth sites of ice crystals preventing normal growth and inducing unusual crystal habits we have performed experiments on the inhibition of ice crystal growth in solutions containing afgp and pvp under standardized conditions and find that the homogeneous nucleation and crystallization rates are sensitive to low concentrations of both substances but afgp is remarkably effective at inhibiting ice crystal growth
lung ventilation in salamanders and the evolution of vertebrate air breathing mechanisms ||||| abstract functional analysis of lung ventilation in salamanders combined with historical analysis of respiratory pumps provides new perspectives on the evolution of breathing mechanisms in vertebrates lung ventilation in the aquatic salamander necturus maculosus was examined by means of cineradiography measurement of buccal and pleuroperitoneal cavity pressures and electromyography of hypaxial musculature in deoxygenated water necturus periodically rises to the surface opens its mouth expands its buccal cavity to draw in fresh air exhales air from the lungs closes its mouth and then compresses its buccal cavity and pumps air into the lungs thus necturus produces only two buccal movements per breath one expansion and one compression necturus shares the use of this two stroke buccal pump with lungfishes frogs and other salamanders the ubiquitous use of this system by basal sarcopterygians is evidence that a two stroke buccal pump is the primitive lung ventilation mechanism for sarcopterygian vertebrates in contrast basal actinopterygian fishes use a four stroke buccal pump in these fishes the buccal cavity expands to fill with expired air compresses to expel the pulmonary air expands to fill with fresh air and then compresses for a second time to pump air into the lungs whether the sarcopterygian two stroke buccal pump and the actinopterygian four stroke buccal pump arose independently whether both are derived from a single primitive osteichthyian breathing mechanism or whether one might be the primitive pattern and the other derived cannot be determined although necturus and lungfishes both use a two stroke buccal pump they differ in their expiration mechanics unlike a lungfish protopterus necturus exhales by contracting a portion of its hypaxial trunk musculature the m transversus abdominis to increase pleuroperitoneal pressure the occurrence of this same expiratory mechanism in amniotes is evidence that the use of hypaxial musculature for expiration but not for inspiration is a primitive tetrapod feature from this observation we hypothesize that aspiration breathing may have evolved in two stages initially from pure buccal pumping to the use of trunk musculature for exhalation but not for inspiration as in necturus and secondarily to the use of trunk musculature for both exhalation and inhalation by costal aspiration as in amniotes
building a home from foam tungara frog foam nest architecture and three phase construction process ||||| frogs that build foam nests floating on water face the problems of over dispersion of the secretions used and eggs being dangerously exposed at the foam air interface nest construction behaviour of tungara frogs engystomops pustulosus has features that may circumvent these problems pairs build nests in periodic bursts of foam production and egg deposition three discrete phases being discernible the first is characterized by a bubble raft without egg deposition and an approximately linear increase in duration of mixing events with time this phase may reduce initial over dispersion of foam precursor materials until a critical concentration is achieved the main building phase is marked by mixing events and start to start intervals being nearly constant in duration during the final phase mixing events do not change in duration but intervals between them increase in an exponential like fashion pairs joining a colonial nesting abbreviate their initial phase presumably by exploiting a pioneer pair s bubble raft thereby reducing energy and material expenditure and time exposed to predators finally eggs are deposited only in the centre of nests with a continuously produced approximately cm deep egg free cortex that protectively encloses hatched larvae in stranded nests
should the wind disturbance patterns observed in natural forests be mimicked in planted forests in the british uplands ||||| summary recent developments in uk forestry policy require the adoption of management practices that maintain and improve the biodiversity of managed forests one approach is to use natural disturbance in unmanaged forests as a template for setting the scale frequency and pattern of forest operations in managed forests this review considers the relevance of this approach for conifer plantations in upland britain the dynamics of british planted forests are compared with the disturbance dynamics of analogous natural forests with particular reference to disturbance by strong winds western hemlock sitka spruce tsuga heterophylla picea sitchensis forests in the pacific north west of north america and particularly south east alaska provide the most promising comparison there are few reports on disturbance in these forests but the regime includes both gap phase and stand replacement dynamics due to wind however the landscape proportion and pattern of resulting structural types are not well defined the dynamics of planted forests in britain are dominated by rotational patch clearfelling which results in regular stand replacement and little possibility of the stands developing beyond the stage of stem exclusion towards old growth the pattern and timing of felling is driven by economic and visual amenity considerations rather than by an attempt to mimic natural disturbance patterns moreover the structural complexity and remnant elements such as deadwood large trees vegetation patches left after large scale disturbance are rarely found after conventional timber harvesting the authors conclude that natural wind disturbance regimes have potential as a reference point for management in british upland forests but at present are not relevant as a model to mimic explicitly this is because the biodiversity benefits of adopting a natural approach in planted forests are unclear compared with management guided by other criteria such as rarity furthermore the spatial and temporal pattern to be mimicked is not sufficiently well understood improved knowledge could inform decisions on the scale and distribution of harvesting across a landscape and modify silvicultural operations to create and maintain the structures and patterns associated with natural disturbance however further research is needed to quantify the spatial and temporal characteristics of wind disturbance in upland forests in britain and in natural forests elsewhere
halogenated dopa in a marine adhesive protein ||||| the sandcastle worm phragmatopoma californica a marine polychaete constructs a tube like shelter by cementing together sand grains using a glue secreted from the building organ in its thorax the glue is a mixture of post translationally modified proteins notably the cement proteins pc and pc with the amino acid dihydroxyphenyl l alanine dopa significant amounts of a halogenated derivative of dopa were isolated from the worm cement following partial acid hydrolysis and capture of catecholic amino acids by phenylboronate affinity chromatography analysis by tandem mass spectrometry and h nmr indicates the dopa derivative to be chloro dihydroxyphenyl l alanine the potential roles of chloro dopa in chemical defense and underwater adhesion are considered
crawling beneath the free surface water snail locomotion ||||| land snails move via adhesive locomotion through muscular contraction and expansion of their foot they transmit waves of shear stress through a thin layer of mucus onto a solid substrate since a free surface cannot support shear stress adhesive locomotion is not a viable propulsion mechanism for water snails that travel inverted beneath the free surface nevertheless the motion of the freshwater snail sorbeoconcha physidae is reminiscent of that of its terrestrial counterparts being generated by the undulation of the snail foot that is separated from the free surface by a thin layer of mucus here a lubrication model is used to describe the mucus flow in the limit of small amplitude interfacial deformations by assuming the shape of the snail foot to be a traveling sine wave and the mucus to be newtonian an evolution equation for the interface shape is obtained and the resulting propulsive force on the snail is calculated this propulsive force is found to be nonzero for moderate values of the c
elastic modulus of hard tissues ||||| this work aims at evaluating the elastic modulus of hard biological tissues by considering their staggered platelet micro structure an analytical expression for the effective modulus along the stagger direction is formulated using three non dimensional structural variables structures with a single staggered hierarchy e g collagen fibril are first studied and predictions are compared with the experimental results and finite element simulations from the literature a more complicated configuration such as an array of fibrils is analyzed next finally a mechanical model is proposed for tooth dentin in which variations in the multi scale structural hierarchy are shown to significantly affect the macroscopic mechanical properties
lymphatic vascular morphogenesis in development physiology and disease ||||| the lymphatic vasculature constitutes a highly specialized part of the vascular system that is essential for the maintenance of interstitial fluid balance uptake of dietary fat and immune response recently there has been an increased awareness of the importance of lymphatic vessels in many common pathological conditions such as tumor cell dissemination and chronic inflammation studies of embryonic development and genetically engineered animal models coupled with the discovery of mutations underlying human lymphedema syndromes have contributed to our understanding of mechanisms regulating normal and pathological lymphatic morphogenesis it is now crucial to use this knowledge for the development of novel therapies for human diseases

evidence that halogenated furanones from delisea pulchra inhibit acylated homoserine lactone ahl mediated gene expression by displacing the ahl signal from its receptor protein ||||| acylated homoserine lactone ahl mediated gene expression controls phenotypes involved in colonization often specifically of higher organisms in both marine and terrestrial environments the marine red alga delisea pulchra produces halogenated furanones which resemble ahls structurally and show inhibitory activity at ecologically realistic concentrations in ahl bioassays evidence is presented that halogenated furanones displace tritiated ohhl n oxohexanoyl l homoserine lactone from escherichia coli cells overproducing luxr with potencies corresponding to their respective inhibitory activities in an ahl regulated bioluminescence assay indicating that this is the mechanism by which furanones inhibit ahl dependent phenotypes alternative mechanisms for this phenomenon are also addressed general metabolic disruption was assessed with two dimensional page revealing limited non ahl related effects a direct chemical interaction between the algal compounds and ahls as monitored by h nmr spectroscopy was shown not to occur in vitro these results support the contention that furanones at the concentrations produced by the alga can control bacterial colonization of surfaces by specifically interfering with ahl mediated gene expression at the level of the luxr protein
hydrodynamics of sailing of the portuguese man of war physalia physalis ||||| physalia physalis commonly known as the portuguese man of war pmw is a peculiar looking colony of specialized polyps the most conspicuous members of this colony are the gas filled sail like float and the long tentacles budding asymmetrically beneath the float this study addresses the sailing of the pmw and in particular the hydrodynamics of its trailing tentacles the interaction between the tentacles and the float and the actual sailing performance this paper attempts to provide answers for two of the many open questions concerning p physalis why does it need a sail and how does it harness the sail
permeability fluctuations in heterogeneous networks with different dimensionality and topology ||||| the purpose of this work was to relate the spatial fluctuations and scaling properties of the transport properties of porous rocks to their underlying pore geometry our approach was to numerically simulate flow through networks of pipes with randomly prescribed radii the permeability k and inverse formation factor f were calculated in a large number of network realizations of varying size and degree of heterogeneity i e the width of the pipe radius distribution we generally observed a large decrease of the ensemble arithmetic averages of k and f with increasing network size i e negative scale effect conversely the ensemble geometric averages showed a moderate positive scale effect in three dimensional simple cubic networks we also found that in networks smaller than x or x x the ensemble standard deviations of k and f had a power law dependence on network size defined as the total number of pipes with an exponent a varying from in homogeneous networks to large negative values depending on lattice topology in highly heterogeneous ones a increased with increasing lattice connectiveness i e with coordination number thus at small scales the network transport properties were characterized by a nonuniversal power law scaling at larger scales we observed a transition to a presumably universal power law scaling with an exponent equal to independently on the degree of heterogeneity dimensionality and lattice topology comparing our results to published experimental data we found a good agreement except in cases where we suspect that the small scale measurements suffered a significant bias indicated by non nested distributions at increasing scales we speculate that the strong positive scale effect generally observed in nature is also caused by sampling bias at small scales
evidence that dimethyl sulfide facilitates a tritrophic mutualism between marine primary producers and top predators ||||| significance this study demonstrates that dimethyl sulfide a chemical cue involved in global climate regulation mediates a tritrophic mutualistic interaction between marine apex predators and primary producers our results imply that marine top predators play a critical role in maintaining both ocean health and global climate our results highlight the need for more collaboration and discussion between micro and macroscale biologists working on global issues in the southern ocean tritrophic mutualistic interactions have been best studied in plant insect systems during these interactions plants release volatiles in response to herbivore damage which in turn facilitates predation on primary consumers or benefits the primary producer by providing nutrients here we explore a similar interaction in the southern ocean food web where soluble iron limits primary productivity dimethyl sulfide has been studied in the context of global climate regulation and is an established foraging cue for marine top predators we present evidence that procellariiform seabird species that use dimethyl sulfide as a foraging cue selectively forage on phytoplankton grazers their contribution of beneficial iron recycled to marine phytoplankton via excretion suggests a chemically mediated link between marine top predators and oceanic primary production
bioluminescent signals spatially amplified by wavelength specific diffusion through the shell of a marine snail ||||| some living organisms produce visible light bioluminescence for intra or interspecific visual communication here we describe a remarkable bioluminescent adaptation in the marine snail hinea brasiliana this species produces a luminous display in response to mechanical stimulation caused by encounters with other motile organisms the light is produced from discrete areas on the snail s body beneath the snail s shell and must thus overcome this structural barrier to be viewed by an external receiver the diffusion and transmission efficiency of the shell is greater than a commercial diffuser reference material most strikingly the shell although opaque and pigmented selectively diffuses the blue green wavelength of the species bioluminescence this diffusion generates a luminous display that is enlarged relative to the original light source this unusual shell thus allows spatially amplified outward transmission of light communication signals from the snail while allowing the animal to remain safely inside its hard protective shell
a novel vertebrate eye using both refractive and reflective optics ||||| sunlight is attenuated rapidly in the ocean resulting in little visually useful light reaching deeper than approximately m in even the clearest water to maximize sensitivity to the relatively brighter downwelling sunlight to view the silhouette of animals above them and to increase the binocular overlap of their eyes many mesopelagic animals have developed upward pointing tubular eyes however these sacrifice the ability to detect bioluminescent and reflective objects in other directions thus some mesopelagic fish with tubular eyes extend their visual fields laterally and or ventrally by lensless ocular diverticula which are thought to provide unfocused images allowing only simple detection of objects with little spatial resolution here we show that a medial mirror within the ventrally facing ocular diverticulum of the spookfish dolichopteryx longipes consisting of a multilayer stack derived from a retinal tapetum is used to reflect light onto a lateral retina the reflective plates are not orientated parallel to the surface of the mirror instead plate angles change progressively around the mirror and computer modeling indicates that this provides a well focused image this is the first report of an ocular image being formed in a vertebrate eye by a mirror
on the mound of macrotermes michaelseni as an organ of respiratory gas exchange ||||| patterns and rates of air movements in the mounds and nests of macrotermes michaelseni were studied using tracer methods wind is a significant source of energy for powering nest ventilation despite the mound being a completely enclosed structure nests are ventilated by a tidal movement of air driven by temporal variation in wind speed and wind direction density gradients sufficiently steep to drive bulk flow by natural convection will be rare however metabolism induced buoyant forces may interact with wind energy in a way that promotes homeostasis of the mound atmosphere
light inside sponges ||||| sponges are the most basal metazoan organisms as sessile filter feeders in marine or freshwater habitats they often live in close association with phototrophic microorganisms active photosynthesis by the associated microorganisms has been believed to be restricted to the outer tissue portion of the sponge hosts however phototrophic microorganisms have also been detected in deeper tissue regions in many cases they are found around spicules siliceous skelettal elements of demosponges and hexactinellids the finding of phototrophic organisms seemingly assembled around spicules led to the hypothesis of a siliceous light transmission system in sponges the principle ability to conduct light was already shown for sponge derived explanted spicules however it was not shown until now that in deed sponges have a light transmission system and can harbour photosynthetically active microorganisms in deeper tissue regions here we show for the first time that as hypothesized year ago sponge spicules in living specimens transmit light into deeper tissue regions our results demonstrate that in opposite to the actual opinion photosynthetically active microorganisms can also live in deeper tissue regions and not only directly beneath the surface when a light transmission system spicules is present our results show the possibility of massive or globular sponges being supplied with photosynthetic products or pathways throughout their whole body implying not only a more important role of these endobioses our findings also elucidate the in situ function of a recently more and more interesting biomaterial which is unique not only for its mechanical electrical and optical properties biosilica is of special interest for the possibility to produce it enzymatically under environmental conditions
elastic energy storage in the mantis shrimp s fast predatory strike ||||| summary storage of elastic energy is key to increasing the power output of many biological systems mantis shrimp stomatopoda must store considerable elastic energy prior to their rapid raptorial strikes however little is known about the dynamics and location of elastic energy storage structures in this system we used computed tomography ct to visualize the mineralization patterns in gonodactylaceus falcatus and high speed videography of odontodactylus scyllarus to observe the dynamics of spring loading using a materials testing apparatus we measured the force and work required to contract the elastic structures in g falcatus there was a positive linear correlation between contraction force and contraction distance alternative model tests further supported the use of a linear model therefore we modeled the system as a hookean spring the force required to fully compress the spring was positively correlated with body mass and appendage size but the spring constant did not scale with body size suggesting a possible role of muscle constraints in the scaling of this system one hypothesized elastic storage structure the saddle only contributed approximately of the total measured force thus suggesting that primary site of elastic energy storage is in the mineralized ventral bars found in the merus segment of the raptorial appendages furthermore the intact system exhibited resilience and severing the saddle resulted in a non significant reduction to resilience the remarkable shapes and mineralization patterns that characterize the mantis shrimp s raptorial appendage further reveal a highly integrated mechanical power amplification system based on exoskeletal elastic energy storage
underwater components of humpback whale bubble net feeding behaviour ||||| summary humpback whales megaptera novaeangliae employ a unique and complex foraging behaviour bubble netting that involves expelling air underwater to form a vertical cylinder ring of bubbles around prey we used digital suction cup tags dtags that concurrently measure pitch roll heading depth and sound khz sampling rate to provide the first depiction of the underwater behaviours in which humpback whales engage during bubble net feeding body mechanics and swim paths were analysed using custom visualization software that animates the underwater track of the whale and quantifies tag sensor values bubble production was identified aurally and through spectrographic analysis of tag audio records we identified two classes of behaviour upward spiral animals events and double loop animals events that whales used to create bubble nets specifically we show the actual swim path of the whales e g number of revolutions turning rate depth interval of spiral when and where in the process bubbles were expelled and the pattern of bubble expulsion used by the animals relative to other baleanopterids bubble netting humpbacks demonstrate increased manoeuvrability probably aided by a unique hydrodynamicly enhanced body form we identified an approximately m depth or depth interval limit to the use of bubble nets and suggest that this limit is due to the physics of bubble dispersal to which humpback whales have behaviourally adapted all animals were feeding with at
interaction between temperature and hypoxia in the alligator ||||| hypoxia elicits behavioral hypothermia in alligators under normoxic conditions the selected body temperature is degrees c however when inspired o is lowered to selected body temperature decreases to degrees c the threshold for the behavioral hypothermia is between and inspired o the lowest threshold measured so far in terrestrial vertebrates this study assessed the physiological significance of the behavioral hypothermia the body temperature was clamped at and degrees c for measurements of ventilation blood gases metabolic rate plasma lactate and acid base status hypoxia induced changes in ventilation acid base status oxygen consumption and lactate were proportional to body temperature being pronounced at degrees c less at degrees c and absent at degrees c the correlation between selected body temperature under severe hypoxia and the measured parameters show that behavioral hypothermia is a beneficial response to hypoxia in alligators
can the ecosystem mimic hypotheses be applied to farms in african savannahs ||||| the first ecosystem mimic hypothesis suggests clear advantages if man made land use systems do not deviate greatly in their resource use patterns from natural ecosystems typical of a given climatic zone the second hypothesis claims that additional advantages will accrue if agroecosystems also maintain a substantial part of the diversity of natural systems we test these hypotheses for the savannah zone of sub saharan africa with its low soil fertility and variable rainfall where annual food crops replace the natural grass understorey of savannah systems water use will decrease and stream and groundwater flow change unless tree density increases relative to the natural situation increasing tree density however will decrease crop yields unless the trees meet specific criteria food crop production in the parkland systems may benefit from lower temperatures under tree canopies but water use by trees providing this shade will prevent crops from benefiting in old parkland trees that farmers have traditionally retained when opening fields for crops water use per unit shade is less than in most fast growing trees introduced for agroforestry trials strong competition between plants adapted to years with different rainfall patterns may stabilise total system productivity but this will be appreciated by a farmer only if the components are of comparable value the best precondition for farmers to maintain diversity in their agroecosystem hinges on the availability of a broad basket of choices without clear winners or best bets
water relations of tetrapod integument ||||| summary the vertebrate integument represents an evolutionary compromise between the needs for mechanical protection and those of sensing the environment and regulating the exchange of materials and energy fibrous keratins evolved as a means of strengthening the integument while simultaneously providing a structural support for lipids which comprise the principal barrier to cutaneous water efflux in terrestrial taxa whereas lipids are of fundamental importance to water barriers the efficacy of these barriers depends in many cases on structural features that enhance or maintain the integrity of function amphibians are exceptional among tetrapods in having very little keratin and a thin stratum corneum thus effective lipid barriers that are present in some specialized anurans living in xeric habitats are external to the epidermis whereas lipid barriers of amniotes exist as a lipid keratin complex within the stratum corneum amphibians prevent desiccation of the epidermis and underlying tissues either by evaporating water from a superficial aqueous film which must be replenished or by shielding the stratum corneum with superficial lipids water barrier function in vertebrates generally appears to be relatively fixed although various species have plasticity to adjust the barrier effectiveness facultatively while it is clear that both phenotypic plasticity and genetic adaptation can account for covariation between environment and skin resistance to water efflux studies of the relative importance of these two phenomena are few fundamental mechanisms for adjusting the skin water barrier include changes in barrier thickness composition and physicochemical properties of cutaneous lipids and or geometry of the barrier within the epidermis while cutaneous lipids have been studied extensively in the contexts of disease and cosmetics relatively little is known about the processes of permeability barrier ontogenesis related to adaptation and environment advances in such knowledge have didactic significance for understanding vertebrate evolution as well as practical application to clinical dermatology
experimental studies and dynamics modeling analysis of the swimming and diving of whirligig beetles coleoptera gyrinidae ||||| whirligig beetles coleoptera gyrinidae can fly through the air swiftly swim on the surface of water and quickly dive across the air water interface the propulsive efficiency of the species is believed to be one of the highest measured for a thrust generating apparatus within the animal kingdom the goals of this research were to understand the distinctive biological mechanisms that allow the beetles to swim and dive while searching for potential bio inspired robotics applications through static and dynamic measurements obtained using a combination of microscopy and high speed imaging parameters associated with the morphology and beating kinematics of the whirligig beetle s legs in swimming and diving were obtained using data obtained from these experiments dynamics models of both swimming and diving were developed through analysis of simulations conducted using these models it was possible to determine several key principles associated with the swimming and diving processes first we determined that curved swimming trajectories were more energy efficient than linear trajectories which explains why they are more often observed in nature second we concluded that the hind legs were able to propel the beetle farther than the middle legs and also that the hind legs were able to generate a larger angular velocity than the middle legs however analysis of circular swimming trajectories showed that the middle legs were important in maintaining stable trajectories and thus were necessary for steering finally we discovered that in order for the beetle to transition from swimming to diving the legs must change the plane in which they beat which provides the force required to alter the tilt angle of the body necessary to break the surface tension of water we have further examined how the principles learned from this study may be applied to the design of bio inspired swimming diving robots
bioluminescence in the ocean origins of biological chemical and ecological diversity ||||| in living color light produced using the chemical process of bioluminescence spans the entire range of the visible spectrum bioluminescence has evolved independently several times in the tree of life however the majority of bioluminescent organisms reside in the open ocean where their bioluminescence helps species in over genera evade predators attract mates and find food widder p reviews recent advances in understanding the evolution and distribution of bioluminescence in marine systems from bacteria to fish a remarkable variety of marine life depends on bioluminescence the chemical generation of light for finding food attracting mates and evading predators disparate biochemical systems and diverse phylogenetic distribution patterns of light emitting organisms highlight the ecological benefits of bioluminescence with biochemical and genetic analyses providing new insights into the mechanisms of its evolution the origins and functions of some bioluminescent systems however remain obscure here i review recent advances in understanding bioluminescence in the ocean and highlight future research efforts that will unite molecular details with ecological and evolutionary relationships
iridescence in the neck feathers of domestic pigeons ||||| we conducted structural characterizations reflection measurements and theoretical simulations on the iridescent green and purple neck feathers of domestic pigeons columba livia domestica we found that both green and purple barbules are composed of an outer keratin cortex layer surrounding a medullary layer the thickness of the keratin cortex layer shows a distinct difference between green and purple barbules green barbules vary colors from green to purple with the observing angle changed from normal to oblique while purple barbules from purple to green in an opposite way both the experimental and theoretical results suggest that structural colors in green and purple neck feathers should originate from the interference in the top keratin cortex layer while the structure beyond acts as a poor mirror
mutations perturbing petal cell shape and anthocyanin synthesis influence bumblebee perception of antirrhinum majus flower colour ||||| we wished to understand the effects on pollinator behaviour of single mutations in plant genes controlling flower appearance to this end we analysed snapdragon flowers antirrhinum majus including the mixta and nivea mutants in controlled laboratory conditions using psychophysical tests with bumblebees the mixta locus controls petal epidermal cell shape and thus the path that incident light takes within the pigment containing cells the effect is that mixta mutant flowers are pink in comparison to the wild type purple flowers and mutants lack the sparkling sheen of wild type flowers that is clearly visible to human observers despite their fundamentally different appearance to humans and even though bees could discriminate the flowers inexperienced bees exhibited no preference for either type and the flowers did not differ in their detectability in a y maze either when the flowers appeared in front of a homogeneous or a dappled background equally counterintuitive effects were found for the non pigmented uv reflecting nivea mutant even though the overall reflectance intensity and uv signal of nivea flowers is several times that of wild type flowers their detectability was significantly reduced relative to wild type flowers in addition naive foragers preferred wild type flowers over nivea mutants even though these generated a stronger signal in all receptor types our results show that single mutations affecting flower signal can have profound effects on pollinator behaviour but not in ways predictable by crude assessments via human perception nor simple quantification of uv signals however current models of bee visual perception predict the observed effects very well
an insect trap as habitat cohesion failure mechanism prevents adhesion of pameridea roridulae bugs to the sticky surface of the plant roridula gorgonias ||||| summary the glandular trichomes of the plant roridula gorgonias release an extremely adhesive visco elastic resinous secretion that traps a variety of insects including those having a considerable body size however the specialized mutualistic mirid bug pameridea roridulae lives and walks on this sticky plant surface without being trapped we have sought to reveal the mechanism underlying the apparent non sticky nature of the cuticle of this bug in this study we have visualized intact plant and insect surfaces using cryo scanning electron microscopy and measured the adhesive properties of the plant secretion on different surfaces we present a combination of structural and experimental results that suggest that a thick and cohesively weak film of an outermost epicuticular greasy secretion acts as a sloughing off layer preventing the formation of contacts between the sticky plant secretion and the solid insect cuticle in a comparative study of fresh cuticle fractures of flies representing a typical prey of r gorgonias a thin fragmentary layer of epicuticular grease was revealed these results indicate that when trapping prey the plant adhesive might form proper contact with solid islands of the insect cuticle that are free of epicuticular grease
optical properties of the iridescent organ of the comb jellyfish beroe cucumis ctenophora ||||| using transmission electron microscopy analytical modeling and detailed numerical simulations the iridescence observed from the comb rows of the ctenophore beroe cucumis was investigated it is shown that the changing coloration which accompanies the beating of comb rows as the animal swims can be explained by the weakly contrasted structure of the refractive index induced by the very coherent packing of locomotory cilia the colors arising from the narrow band gap reflection are shown to be highly saturated and as a function of the incidence angle cover a wide range of the visible and ultraviolet spectrum the high transparency of the structure at the maximal bioluminescence wavelength is also explained
mechanics without muscle biomechanical inspiration from the plant world ||||| plant and animal biomechanists have much in common although their frame of reference differs they think about the natural world in similar ways while researchers studying animals might explore airflow around flapping wings the actuation of muscles in arms and legs or the material properties of spider silk researchers studying plants might explore the flow of water around fluttering seaweeds the grasping ability of climbing vines or the material properties of wood here we summarize recent studies of plant biomechanics highlighting several current research themes in the field expulsion of high speed reproductive projectiles generation of slow movements by shrinking and swelling cell walls effects of ontogenetic shifts in mechanical properties of stems flexible reconfiguration and material properties of seaweeds under crashing waves and the development of botanically inspired commercial products our hope is that this synopsis will resonate with both plant and animal biologists encourage cross pollination across disciplines and promote fruitful interdisciplinary collaborations in the future
reflectins the unusual proteins of squid reflective tissues ||||| a family of unusual proteins is deposited in flat structural platelets in reflective tissues of the squid euprymna scolopes these proteins which we have named reflectins are encoded by at least six genes in three subfamilies and have no reported homologs outside of squids reflectins possess five repeating domains which are highly conserved among members of the family the proteins have a very unusual composition with four relatively rare residues tyrosine methionine arginine and tryptophan comprising of a reflectin and several common residues alanine isoleucine leucine and lysine occurring in none of the family members these protein based reflectors in squids provide a marked example of nanofabrication in animal systems
harbor seal vibrissa morphology suppresses vortex induced vibrations ||||| summary harbor seals phoca vitulina often live in dark and turbid waters where their mystacial vibrissae or whiskers play an important role in orientation besides detecting and discriminating objects by direct touch harbor seals use their whiskers to analyze water movements for example those generated by prey fish or by conspecifics even the weak water movements left behind by objects that have passed by earlier can be sensed and followed accurately hydrodynamic trail following while scanning the water for these hydrodynamic signals at a swimming speed in the order of meters per second the seal keeps its long and flexible whiskers in an abducted position largely perpendicular to the swimming direction remarkably the whiskers of harbor seals possess a specialized undulated surface structure the function of which was up to now unknown here we show that this structure effectively changes the vortex street behind the whiskers and reduces the vibrations that would otherwise be induced by the shedding of vortices from the whiskers vortex induced vibrations using force measurements flow measurements and numerical simulations we find that the dynamic forces on harbor seal whiskers are by at least an order of magnitude lower than those on sea lion zalophus californianus whiskers which do not share the undulated structure the results are discussed in the light of pinniped sensory biology and potential biomimetic applications
biomimetic strain sensing microstructure for improved strain sensor fabrication results and optical characterization ||||| this paper describes the fabrication and early optical characterization results of a new biomimetic strain sensing microstructure the microstructures were inspired from the campaniform sensillum a highly sensitive strain sensor found in the exocuticle layer of insects we investigate the natural strain sensor characteristics by mimicking some of its simplest structural features blind hole and membrane structural features were combined and fabricated as membrane in recess microstructure to investigate the strain sensing or strain amplifying property of the microstructure an optical characterization setup was devised based on the interference pattern formed by reflected laser beams from different surfaces of the microstructures preliminary qualitative analysis of the results obtained shows unsimilar intensity level changes as a function of spatial location on the membrane thus indicated the biomimetic microstructure s strain amplifying property this property could be utilized for future improvement of currently available planar based conventional strain sensors
genetic evidence for natural product mediated plant plant allelopathy in rice oryza sativa ||||| there is controversy as to whether specific natural products play a role in directly mediating antagonistic plant plant interactions that is allelopathy if proved to exist such phenomena would hold considerable promise for agronomic improvement of staple food crops such as rice oryza sativa however while substantiated by the presence of phytotoxic compounds at potentially relevant concentrations demonstrating a direct role for specific natural products in allelopathy has been difficult because of the chemical complexity of root and plant litter exudates this complexity can be bypassed via selective genetic manipulation to ablate production of putative allelopathic compounds but such an approach previously has not been applied the rice diterpenoid momilactones provide an example of natural products for which correlative biochemical evidence has been obtained for a role in allelopathy here we apply reverse genetics using knock outs of the relevant diterpene synthases copalyl diphosphate synthase oscps and kaurene synthase like osksl to demonstrate that rice momilactones are involved in allelopathy including suppressing growth of the widespread rice paddy weed barnyard grass echinochloa crus galli thus our results not only provide novel genetic evidence for natural product mediated allelopathy but also furnish a molecular target for breeding and metabolic engineering of this important crop plant
numerical simulation of electroosmotic flow near earthworm surface ||||| the electroosmotic flow near an earthworm surface is simulated numerically to further understand the anti soil adhesion mechanism of earthworm a lattice poisson method is employed to solve electric potential and charge distributions in the electric double layer along the earthworm surface the external electric field is obtained by solving a laplace equation the electroosmotic flow controlled by the navier stokes equations with external body force is simulated by the lattice boltzmann method a benchmark test shows that accurate electric potential distributions can be obtained by the lpm the simulation shows that the moving vortices which probably contribute to anti soil adhesion are formed near earthworm body surface by the nonuniform and variational electrical force
shape of tropoelastin the highly extensible protein that controls human tissue elasticity ||||| elastin enables the reversible deformation of elastic tissues and can withstand decades of repetitive forces tropoelastin is the soluble precursor to elastin the main elastic protein found in mammals little is known of the shape and mechanism of assembly of tropoelastin as its unique composition and propensity to self associate has hampered structural studies in this study we solve the nanostructure of full length and corresponding overlapping fragments of tropoelastin using small angle x ray and neutron scattering allowing us to identify discrete regions of the molecule tropoelastin is an asymmetric coil with a protruding foot that encompasses the c terminal cell interaction motif we show that individual tropoelastin molecules are highly extensible yet elastic without hysteresis to perform as highly efficient molecular nanosprings our findings shed light on how biology uses this single protein to build durable elastic structures that allow for cell attachment to an appended foot we present a unique model for head to tail assembly which allows for the propagation of the molecule s asymmetric coil through a stacked spring design
competition for space disturbance and the structure of a benthic stream community ||||| interspecific competition for space limits the distribution and abundance of many ben thic insects on stones in a western montana stream the sessile caddisfly larva leucotrichia pictipes is territorial and aggressively eliminates conspecifics and other species from its foraging territories territoriality produces an intraspecific pattern of regular spacing and negative spatial associations between leucotrichia and several other sessile insects parargyractis confusalis rheotanytarsus sp and eukiefferiella sp experimental removals of leucotrichia resulted in higher densities of other sessile species and several mobile insects including baetis glossosoma and simulium these insects show broad microhabitat overlap with leucotrichia competition with leucotrichia limits their dis tributions and abundances within otherwise suitable microhabitats leucotrichia is the only species that monopolizes large areas of space physical disturbances interrupt the formation of competitive monopolies by leucotrichia during seasonal reduced flows leucotrichia is eliminated from stones and boulders in shallow water greater densities of a short lived sessile species with multiple annual generations occupy this ephemeral spatial resource on permanently submerged stones leucotrichia competitively affects a large part of the benthic fauna on small stones that overturn with higher frequencies during flooding leucotrichia densities are reduced and species abundances are highly equitable large more stable substrates with greater densities of leucotrichia are characterized by lower species evenness
how delisea pulchra furanones affect quorum sensing and swarming motility in serratia liquefaciens mg ||||| halogenated furanones produced by the benthic marine macroalga delisea pulchra inhibit swarming motility of serratia liquefaciens mg this study demonstrates that exogenously added furanones control transcription of the quorum sensing regulated gene swra in competition with the cognate signal molecule n butanoyl l homoserine lactone this in turn results in reduced production of the surface active compound serrawettin w which is crucial for surface translocation of the differentiated swarm cells it is demonstrated that furanones interfere with interspecies communication during swarming of mixed cultures and that the mode of interference in quorum sensing control and interspecies communication is not through inhibition of autoinducer synthesis
day neutral flowering represses constans to prevent arabidopsis flowering early in short days w oa ||||| this work describes the flowering time gene day neutral flowering dnf which acts in the same flowering pathway as constans co dnf is a membrane bound e ligase that represses co expression and plays an important role in maintaining low levels of co expression in short days it is thus essential for the ability of the arabidopsis plant to have a different flowering response in long and short days the photoperiodic response in arabidopsis thaliana requires the precise regulation of constans co expression in relation to the light period during the day in short days sds levels of co expression are normally low during the light period and this results in delayed flowering compared with long days lds when co expression rises to high levels before the end of the light period we identified a novel flowering time gene called day neutral flowering dnf that acts in the same flowering pathway as co dnf is a membrane bound e ligase that represses co expression and plays an important role in maintaining low levels of co expression in sds the effect of dnf on the rhythm of co expression is essential for the photoperiodic response of arabidopsis enabling it to have a different flowering response in lds and sds
friction behavior of a microstructured polymer surface inspired by snake skin ||||| summary the aim of this study was to understand the influence of microstructures found on ventral scales of the biological model lampropeltis getula californiae the california king snake on the friction behavior for this purpose we compared snake inspired anisotropic microstructured surfaces to other microstructured surfaces with isotropic and anisotropic geometry to exclude that the friction measurements were influenced by physico chemical variations all friction measurements were performed on the same epoxy polymer for frictional measurements a microtribometer was used original data were processed by fast fourier transformation fft with a zero frequency related to the average friction and other peaks resulting from periodic stick slip behavior the data showed that the specific ventral surface ornamentation of snakes does not only reduce the frictional coefficient and generate anisotropic frictional properties but also reduces stick slip vibrations during sliding which might be an adaptation to reduce wear based on this extensive comparative study of different microstructured polymer samples it was experimentally demonstrated that the friction induced stick slip behavior does not solely depend on the frictional coefficient of the contact pair
physicochemical characterization of the microhabitat of the epibionts associated with alvinella pompejana a hydrothermal vent annelid ||||| abstract alvinella pompejana is a polychaetous annelid that inhabits narrow tubes along the walls of high temperature hydrothermal vent chimneys the worm hosts a rich community of epibiotic bacteria that coats its dorsal surface although the worm tube microhabitat is a challenging environment to sample characterizing the thermal and geochemical regime is important for understanding the ecology of the worm and its bacteria as the worm spends most of its time inside the tube we characterized the physicochemical conditions of diffuse hydrothermal flow inside inhabited worm tubes using in situ analysis and wet chemical analysis of discrete water samples thermistor probes deployed inside worm tubes measured temperatures ranging from degc to degc while temperatures at tube orifices ranged from degc to degc in situ electrochemical analysis of tube fluids revealed undetectable oxygen
structure innervation and response properties of integumentary sensory organs in crocodilians ||||| summary integumentary sensory organs isos are densely distributed on the jaws of crocodilians and on body scales of members of the families crocodilidae and gavialidae we examined the distribution anatomy innervation and response properties of isos on the face and body of crocodilians and documented related behaviors for an alligatorid alligator mississippiensis and a crocodylid crocodylus niloticus each of the isos roughly in a mississippiensis and in c niloticus was innervated by networks of afferents supplying multiple different mechanoreceptors electrophysiological recordings from the trigeminal ganglion and peripheral nerves were made to isolate single unit receptive fields and to test possible osmoreceptive and electroreceptive functions multiple small mm receptive fields often from a single iso were recorded from the premaxilla the rostral dentary the gingivae and the distal digits these responded to a median threshold of mn the less densely innervated caudal margins of the jaws had larger receptive fields mm and higher thresholds mn rapidly adapting slowly adapting type i and slowly adapting type ii responses were identified based on neuronal responses several rapidly adapting units responded maximally to vibrations at hz consistent with reports of the isos role in detecting prey generated water surface ripples despite crocodilians armored bodies the isos imparted a mechanical sensitivity exceeding that of primate fingertips we conclude that crocodilian isos have diverse functions including detection of water movements indicating when to bite based on direct contact of pursued prey and fine tactile discrimination of items held in the jaws
tissue and life stage distribution of a defensin gene in the lone star tick amblyomma americanum ||||| abstract the transcript sequence of the amblyomma americanum linnaeus acari ixodidae defensin termed amercin amn was ascertained and a bp amn coding region identified the gene encodes a amino acid prepropeptide with a putative amino acid mature peptide this gene shows little similarity to either of the defensins from amblyomma hebraeum koch the only other amblyomma species for which a defensin has been described sequence comparisons with other tick defensins reveal amn to be shorter bp or amino acids than the ixodes scapularis linnaeus acari ixodidae and dermacentor variabilis say acari ixodidae defensin sequences the amercin prepropeptide has and similarity with the i scapularis and d variabilis prepropeptides respectively whereas the mature amercin peptide has and similarity with the mature peptides of these ticks similarity with other tick defensins ranges from to in a americanum defensin transcript was found in the midgut fat body and salivary gland tissues as well as in the haemocytes defensin transcript was also present in early stage eggs less than h old late stage eggs approximately weeks old larvae and nymphs of a americanum and i scapularis both of which are vector competent for borrelia spirochetes
nitrogen transformations in a through flow wetland revealed using whole ecosystem pulsed n additions ||||| we used pulsed and continuous additions of n together with whole ecosystem metabolism measurements to elucidate the mechanisms of nitrogen n transformations in a small m through flow wetland situated along a stream from measurements of the wetland inflow and outflow we observed a consistent decrease in nitrate by of inflow concentrations while ammonium increased by an order of magnitude outflow ammonium concentrations oscillated in a diel cycle inverse to the concentration of dissolved oxygen i e greater ammonium export at night the pulsed n additions showed little uptake of nitrate over time in the wetland and rapid daytime uptake of ammonium from the water column rate constant kt h a steady state nammonium addition demonstrated a similar rate of ammonium uptake kt h no detectable nitrification and highlighted the spatial pattern of ammonium and nitrate uptake within the wetland porewater concentration profiles suggest high rates of net ammonium diffusion from the sediments ecosystem metabolism measurements indicate that release was attenuated during the day by autotrophic uptake resulting in lower ammonium export during the day denitrification rates were modeled from dissolved n ar ratios but they were not sufficient to account for the observed loss in nitrate nitrate was removed near the pond inflow but not actively cycled throughout the pond while the balance between sediment release and subsequent uptake of ammonium from the water column dominated n cycling in this wetland
on the buoyancy of the pearly nautilus ||||| nautilus macromphalus sowerby when freshly caught was close to neutral buoyancy having a weight in sea water of about of its weight in air the animals without their shells varied considerably in density but the volume of the shell was an approximately constant fraction of the total volume of the whole animal and whole animals were brought approximately to the same density by havingmore or less liquid inside the chambers of the shell about of the gas space in the shell was used to support the weight of the shell itself in sea water in an adult animal the centre of buoyancy was found to be about mm above the centre of gravity which made the animal very stable in its natural swimming position a couple of about g cm being required to turn it through deg the pearly partsof the chamber walls were impermeable to sea water but the chalky and horny siphuncular tubes joining the septal necks were very porous the most newly formed tenor so chambers were the only ones to contain liquids in appreciable volume and theydid this in diminishing amounts from the newest to the oldest the watery liquids found within the chambers were always hypotonic to sea water and sometimes markedly so they contained principally sodium and chloride ions one animal was in the process of forming a new chamber this incomplete chamber was completely full of liquidwith an osmolarity close to that of sea water but differing in composition from seawater
grip and detachment of locusts on inverted sandpaper substrates ||||| locusts locusta migratoria manilensis are characterized by their strong flying and grasping ability research on the grasping mechanism and behaviour of locusts on sloping substrates plays an important role in elucidating the mechanics of hexapod locomotion data on the maximum angles of slope at which locusts can grasp stably critical angles of detachment were obtained from high speed video recordings at fps the grasping forces were collected by using two sensors in situations where all left legs were standing on one and the right legs on the other sensor plate these data were used to illustrate the grasping ability of locusts on slopes with varying levels of roughness the grasping morphologies of locusts bodies and tarsi were observed and the surface roughness as well as diameters of their claw tips was measured under a microscope to account for the grasping mechanism of these insects on the sloping substrate the results showed that the claw tips and part of the pads were in contact with the inverted substrate when the mean particle diameter was in the range of um the interaction between pads and substrates may improve the stability of contact and claw tips may play a key role in keeping the attachment reliable a model was developed to explain the significant effects of the relative size of claw tips and mean particle diameter on grasping ability as well as the observed increase in lateral force times greater than the normal force during detachment with increasing slope angle which indicates that the lateral force may be extremely important in keeping the contact reliable this research lays the groundwork for the probable design and development of biomimetic robotics
foam nest components of the tungara frog a cocktail of proteins conferring physical and biological resilience ||||| the foam nests of the tungara frog engystomops pustulosus form a biocompatible incubation medium for eggs and sperm while resisting considerable environmental and microbiological assault we have shown that much of this behaviour can be attributed to a cocktail of six proteins designated ranaspumins rsn to rsn which predominate in the foam these fall into two discernable classes based on sequence analysis and biophysical properties rsn with an amphiphilic amino acid sequence unlike any hitherto reported exhibits substantial detergent like surfactant activity necessary for production of foam yet is harmless to the membranes of eggs and spermatozoa a further four rsn to rsn are lectins three of which are similar to fucolectins found in teleosts but not previously identified in a land vertebrate though with a carbohydrate binding specificity different from previously described fucolectins the sixth rsn is structurally similar to proteinase inhibitors of the cystatin class but does not itself appear to exhibit any such activity the nest foam itself however does exhibit potent cystatin activity rsn encoding genes are transcribed in many tissues of the adult frogs but the full cocktail is present only in oviduct glands combinations of lectins and cystatins have known roles in plants and animals for defence against microbial colonization and insect attack tungara nest foam displays a novel synergy of selected elements of innate defence plus a specialized surfactant protein comprising a previously unreported strategy for protection of unattended reproductive stages of animals
cross linking chemistry of squid beak ||||| in stark contrast to most aggressive predators dosidicus gigas jumbo squids do not use minerals in their powerful mouthparts known as beaks their beaks instead consist of a highly sclerotized chitinous composite with incremental hydration from the tip to the base we previously reported l dihydroxyphenylalanine dopa histidine dopa his as an important covalent cross link providing mechanical strengthening to the beak material here we present a more complete characterization of the sclerotization chemistry and describe additional cross links from d gigas beak all cross links presented in this report share common building blocks a family of di tri and tetra histidine catecholic adducts that were separated by affinity chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography hplc and identified by tandem mass spectroscopy and proton nuclear magnetic resonance h nmr the data provide additional insights into the unusually high cross link density found in mature beaks furthermore we propose both a low molecular weight catechol and peptidyl dopa to be sclerotization agents of squid beak this appears to represent a new strategy for forming hard tissue in animals the interplay between covalent cross linking and dehydration on the graded properties of the beaks is discussed
crossflow filtration in suspension feeding fishes ||||| rows of comb like or tufted gill rakers in the oral cavity of suspension feeding fishes for example herring anchovies and tilapia have been thought to serve as non porous barriers that direct particle laden water to the sticky oral roof where particles are retained as water exits from the oral cavity conventional dead end filters that sieve particles from water exiting between rakers or sticky filters that retain particles encountered by a hydrosol filtration mechanism here we present data from computational fluid dynamics and video endoscopy in suspension feeding fish indicating that the rakers of three distantly related species function instead as a crossflow filter particles are concentrated inside the oral cavity as filtrate exits between the rakers but particles are not retained on the rakers instead the high velocity crossflow along the rakers carries particles away from the raker surfaces and transports the particles towards the oesophagus this crossflow prevents particles from clogging the gaps between the rakers and solves the mystery of particle transport from the rakers to the oesophagus
effect of abiotic factors on the foraging strategy of the orb web spider argiope keyserlingi araneae araneidae ||||| environmental conditions such as light level background contrast and temperature might influence a spider s prey capture success and risk of predation thus it may often be advantageous for spiders to adjust web building behaviour in response to variation in these environmental conditions this hypothesis was examined in a study of the construction of webs and web decorations conspicuous strands of silk at the hub of the web of the orb web spider argiope keyserlingi web decorations are thought to have one or more separate functions they may attract prey deter predators or advertise the web to oncoming birds thus preventing web damage in this series of experiments relationships between weather parameters and the construction of webs and web decorations were considered in complementary laboratory experiments a keyserlingi spiders were exposed to two different light levels and lx background contrasts black and white and temperature conditions and degc of the available weather parameters only temperature was significantly related to web decorating behaviour but not to web size in the laboratory temperature also influenced web decorating behaviour and spiders in dim light lx constructed larger webs and longer decorations background contrast did not significantly alter web size or web decorations these data suggest that when prey availability is reduced at low temperatures spiders may use web decorations to attract prey to the web similarly in dim light spiders may build more and larger decorations to increase the visual signal to approaching prey or to advertise the web to oncoming birds
capillarity based switchable adhesion ||||| drawing inspiration from the adhesion abilities of a leaf beetle found in nature we have engineered a switchable adhesion device the device combines two concepts the surface tension force from a large number of small liquid bridges can be significant capillarity based adhesion and these contacts can be quickly made or broken with electronic control switchable the device grabs or releases a substrate in a fraction of a second via a low voltage pulse that drives electroosmotic flow energy consumption is minimal because both the grabbed and released states are stable equilibria that persist with no energy added to the system notably the device maintains the integrity of an array of hundreds to thousands of distinct interfaces during active reconfiguration from droplets to bridges and back despite the natural tendency of the liquid toward coalescence we demonstrate the scaling of adhesion strength with the inverse of liquid contact size this suggests that strengths approaching those of permanent bonding adhesives are possible as feature size is scaled down in addition controllability is fast and efficient because the attachment time and required voltage also scale down favorably the device features compact size no solid moving parts and is made of common materials
how effective are created or restored freshwater wetlands for nitrogen and phosphorus removal a systematic review ||||| backgroundeutrophication of aquatic environments is a major environmental problem in large parts of the world in europe eu legislation the water framework directive and the marine strategy framework directive international conventions ospar helcom and national environmental objectives emphasize the need to reduce the input of nutrients to freshwater and marine environments a widely used method to achieve this is to allow water to pass through a created or restored wetland however the large variation in measured nutrient removal rates in such wetlands calls for a systematic review methodssearches for primary studies were performed in electronic databases and on the internet one author performed the screening of all retrieved articles at the title and abstract level to check that the screening was consistent and complied with the agreed inclusion exclusion criteria subsets of articles were screened by the other authors when screening at full text level the articles were evenly distributed among the authors kappa tests were used to evaluate screening consistency relevant articles remaining after screening were critically appraised and assigned to three quality categories from two of which data were extracted quantitative synthesis consists of meta analyses and response surface analyses regressions were performed using generalized additive models that can handle nonlinear relationships and interaction effects resultssearches generated unique records after screening on relevance and critical appraisal articles including wetlands were used for data extraction most of the wetlands were situated in europe and north america the removal rate of both total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp is highly dependent on the loading rate significant relationships were also found for annual average air temperature t and wetland area a median removal rates of tn and tp were and g m year respectively removal efficiency for tn was significantly correlated with hydrologic loading rate hlr and t and the median was with a confidence interval of removal efficiency for tp was significantly correlated with inlet tp concentration hlr t and a median tp removal efficiency was with a confidence interval of although there are small differences in average values between the two quality categories the variation is considerably smaller among high quality studies compared to studies with lower quality this suggests that part of the large variation between studies may be explained by less rigorous study designs conclusionson average created and restored wetlands significantly reduce the transport of tn and tp in treated wastewater and urban and agricultural runoff and may thus be effective in efforts to counteract eutrophication however restored wetlands on former farmland were significantly less efficient than other wetlands at tp removal in addition wetlands with precipitation driven hlrs and or hydrologic pulsing show significantly lower tp removal efficiencies compared to wetlands with controlled hlrs loading rate inlet concentrations x hydraulic loading rates needs to be carefully estimated as part of the wetland design more research is needed on the effects of hydrologic pulsing on wetlands there is also a lack of evidence for long term years performance of wetlands
spiderweb deformation induced by electrostatically charged insects ||||| capture success of spider webs has been associated with their microstructure ornamentation and wind induced vibrations indirect evidence suggests that statically charged objects can attract silk thread but web deformations induced by charged insects have not yet been described here we show under laboratory conditions that electrostatically charged honeybees green bottle flies fruit flies aphids and also water drops falling near webs of cross spiders araneus diadematus induce rapid thread deformation that enhances the likelihood of physical contact and thus of prey capture
shared decision making drives collective movement in wild baboons ||||| baboons follow the pack not the leader how do groups of animals including humans make decisions that affect the entire group evidence collected from schooling animals suggests that the process is somewhat democratic with nearest neighbors and the majority shaping overall collective behavior in animals with hierarchical social structures such as primates or wolves however such democracy may be complicated by dominance strandburg peshkin et al monitored all the individuals within a baboon troop continuously over the course of their daily activities even within this highly socially structured species movement decisions emerged via a shared process thus democracy may be an inherent trait of collective behavior science this issue p democracy guides group decisions in baboons even in the presence of strong social hierarchies conflicts of interest about where to go and what to do are a primary challenge of group living however it remains unclear how consensus is achieved in stable groups with stratified social relationships tracking wild baboons with a high resolution global positioning system and analyzing their movements relative to one another reveals that a process of shared decision making governs baboon movement rather than preferentially following dominant individuals baboons are more likely to follow when multiple initiators agree when conflicts arise over the direction of movement baboons choose one direction over the other when the angle between them is large but they compromise if it is not these results are consistent with models of collective motion suggesting that democratic collective action emerging from simple rules is widespread even in complex socially stratified societies
modelling of the frictional behaviour of the snake skin covered by anisotropic surface nanostructures ||||| previous experimental data clearly revealed anisotropic friction on the ventral scale surface of snakes however it is known that frictional properties of the ventral surface of the snake skin range in a very broad range and the degree of anisotropy ranges as well to a quite strong extent this might be due to the variety of species studied diversity of approaches used for the friction characterization and or due to the variety of substrates used as a counterpart in the experiments in order to understand the interactions between the nanostructure arrays of the ventral surface of the snake skin this study was undertaken which is aimed at numerical modeling of frictional properties of the structurally anisotropic surfaces in contact with various size of asperities the model shows that frictional anisotropy appears on the snake skin only on the substrates with a characteristic range of roughness which is less or comparable with dimensions of the skin microstructure in other words scale of the skin relief should reflect an adaptation to the particular range of surfaces asperities of the substrate
spider silk as a novel high performance biomimetic muscle driven by humidity ||||| summary the abrupt halt of a bumble bee s flight when it impacts the almost invisible threads of an orb web provides an elegant example of the amazing strength and toughness of spider silk spiders depend upon these properties for survival yet the impressive performance of silk is not limited solely to tensile mechanics here we show that silk also exhibits powerful cyclic contractions allowing it to act as a high performance mimic of biological muscles these contractions are actuated by changes in humidity alone and repeatedly generate work times greater than the equivalent mass of human muscle although we demonstrate that this response is general and occurs weakly in diverse hydrophilic materials the high modulus of spider silk is such that it generates exceptional force furthermore because this effect already operates at the level of single silk fibers only mm in diameter it can easily be scaled across the entire size range at which biological muscles operate by contrast the most successful synthetic muscles developed so far are driven by electric voltage such that they cannot scale easily across large ranges in cross sectional areas the potential applicability of silk muscles is further enhanced by our finding that silkworm fibers also exhibit cyclic contraction because they are already available in commercial quantities the simplicity of using wet or dry air to drive the biomimetic silk muscle fibers and the incredible power generated by silk offer unique possibilities in designing lightweight and compact actuators for robots and micro machines new sensors and green energy production
discovery of skin alkaloids in a miniaturized eleutherodactylid frog from cuba ||||| four phylogenetically independent lineages of frogs are currently known to sequester lipid soluble skin alkaloids for which a dietary source has been demonstrated we report here a remarkable fifth such instance in eleutherodactylus iberia and eleutherodactylus orientalis two species of miniaturized frogs of the family eleutherodactylidae from cuba six pumiliotoxins and two indolizidines were found in e iberia one of the smallest frogs in the world and characterized by a contrasting colour pattern for which we hypothesize an aposematic function analyses of stomach content indicated a numerical prevalence of mites with an important proportion of oribatids a group of arthropods known to contain one of the pumiliotoxins detected in e iberia this suggests that miniaturization and specialization to small prey may have favoured the acquisition of dietary skin alkaloids in these amphibians
dynamics of drying in phenolically tanned materials ||||| the cuticle of a maggot goes through a mechanical transition when it dries increasing in stiffness by about an order of magnitude e g from gpa to gpa as the water content drops from about g g weight of water per unit dry weight to g g thus stiffness represents the loss of freezable water and is more or less diagnostic of a material stabilized by hydrogen bonds further loss in water results in a smaller increase in stiffness in natural systems the water content is controlled by the addition of phenolic residues resulting in tanning or sclerotisation which drives the matrix components towards co operative interaction and makes the material permanently waterproof
two chemosensory receptors together mediate carbon dioxide detection in drosophila ||||| blood feeding insects including the malaria mosquito anopheles gambiae use highly specialized and sensitive olfactory systems to locate their hosts this is accomplished by detecting and following plumes of volatile host emissions which include carbon dioxide co co is sensed by a population of olfactory sensory neurons in the maxillary palps of mosquitoes and in the antennae of the more genetically tractable fruitfly drosophila melanogaster the molecular identity of the chemosensory co receptor however remains unknown here we report that co responsive neurons in drosophila co express a pair of chemosensory receptors gr a and gr a at both larval and adult life stages we identify mosquito homologues of gr a and gr a gprgr and gprgr and show that these are co expressed in a gambiae maxillary palps we show that gr a and gr a together are sufficient for olfactory co chemosensation in drosophila ectopic expression of gr a and gr a together confers co sensitivity on co insensitive olfactory neurons but neither gustatory receptor alone has this function mutant flies lacking gr a lose both electrophysiological and behavioural responses to co knowledge of the molecular identity of the insect olfactory co receptors may spur the development of novel mosquito control strategies designed to take advantage of this unique and critical olfactory pathway this in turn could bolster the worldwide fight against malaria and other insect borne diseases
